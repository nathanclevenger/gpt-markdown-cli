# The Dos and Don'ts of SaaS Pricing Strategy

SaaS pricing can make or break a company's success. A well-designed pricing strategy can earn a SaaS company more recurring revenue, decrease customer acquisition costs, and reduce churn rates. That's why it's crucial to get your pricing right from the start. By avoiding common pricing mistakes and implementing the best practices, you can create a winning pricing strategy. Here are some dos and don'ts to follow when setting the price for your SaaS product.

## Do explore your market

Before you set the price for your SaaS product, you need to research your target market comprehensively. Find out what pricing structure works best for a company like yours. Evaluate the competition, understand the customers' needs, and the value they attach to your product. Once you know your market, you can then start developing your pricing strategy.

## Don't make pricing assumptions

SaaS pricing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Pricing something too low might seem like a good idea, but it could hinder long-term growth. Similarly, pricing something too high makes it inaccessible to those who benefit most from the SaaS product. Don't make assumptions about your customers' willingness to pay, seek data-driven information on where your pricing should be.

## Do focus on value

Pricing shouldn't be solely based on the cost of development, maintenance, and delivery. Instead, it should be based on the value that your product offers to the customer. The value-based pricing model is a must-do for SaaS pricing strategies. It helps you differentiate your product in the market and convey the benefits of the product to the customer.

## Don't complicate pricing

Simplicity is very tempting when it comes to SaaS pricing. You want customers to be clear on what they are receiving and how much they are paying. Ensure that pricing is user-friendly and can be understood quickly. Avoid complex pricing models with hidden fees or tampering with the basic plan for the sake of differentiation. Customers want pricing that is transparent and easy to use.

## Do offer flexible pricing

SaaS pricing strategy should be flexible enough to adjust to different segments of the market. Offering a tiered pricing system or custom pricing opens doors for multiple customer types. You can tailor your pricing model to fit specific industries, company sizes or individual customers.

## Don't offer too many pricing options

It may be tempting to offer too many options, but offering too many pricing options may overwhelm potential customers. With too many pricing options, customers may end up not subscribing at all. Opt for a few strategic options that work best for the customer and take the complexity out of pricing decisions.

## Do provide clear pricing information

Transparency is key when it comes to SaaS pricing. To avoid customer frustration, ensure your pricing information is clear and easy to find on your website. Offer detailed information on what is included in the packages, or how extra charges are incorporated in the billing, with rates outlined upfront. Make customers aware of any changes in pricing early, and let them know if anything has changed.

## Don't hesitate to change pricing

SaaS pricing strategies are not set in stone. Perform pricing tests, and smart A/B testing before, during, and after launch, to find out what works best for customers. Be willing to change pricing models when necessary, based on customer feedback and market dynamics. Keep adjusting your pricing strategy until you are satisfied it is delivering the results your business requires.

## Do consider offering free trials

Offering a free trial is a common strategy for SaaS companies. A free trial reduces customer acquisition costs, gives customers an opportunity to evaluate the product and sets the stage for the customer relationship. Ensure the trial is compatible with your business model, otherwise, it could lead to a profit-loss. Set a specific trial length and make sure the onboarding process is simple and customers receive the necessary support throughout the trial.

## Don't overlook pricing communication

Pricing can be a contentious issue, with some customers attaching their emotional baggage to the price tag. Communicate pricing changes clearly and honestly. Help your customers understand why you are making changes and how it will benefit them. Send timely notifications, employ a direct and open communication strategy, and always prepare for customers' reactions.

## Conclusion

Designing a winning pricing strategy requires time, research, and testing. By considering the key factors of exploring the market, focusing on value, offering flexibility, and providing clarity, you will create a pricing strategy that is fit for your market. By avoiding some of the common pitfalls such as making pricing assumptions, complicating pricing or offering too many pricing options, you can steer clear from potential tanks in revenue. Finally, pricing communication and evolution cannot be emphasized enough – keep communication with customers open and transparent – listen to their feedback and prepare yourselves to change pricing strategies if you need to. With these dos and don'ts as a guide, you can master SaaS pricing and establish a pricing strategy that boosts your business success.
