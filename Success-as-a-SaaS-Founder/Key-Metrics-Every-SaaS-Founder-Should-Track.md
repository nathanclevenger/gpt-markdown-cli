# Key Metrics Every SaaS Founder Should Track

Starting a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business takes more than just a good idea. You must have a solid understanding of your key metrics to build a profitable and sustainable business. Measuring the right metrics can help you understand how your business is performing, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate success to investors.

Here are some key metrics every SaaS founder should track:

## Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

MRR is the king of SaaS metrics. It is the sum of all revenue generated by your customers in a given month. Tracking monthly recurring revenue (MRR) helps you understand how consistent your revenue stream is and provides critical insight into your business’s financial health. 

For example, if your MRR is $10,000 in January and $12,000 in February, you can see that your revenue is trending in the right direction. You can also use MRR to forecast future revenue and make decisions on hiring, marketing, and other expenses.

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the cost of acquiring a new customer. This metric is essential for understanding how efficiently you are acquiring customers and how sustainable your business is. 

To calculate CAC, divide your sales and marketing expenses by the number of customers you acquired in a given period. For example, if you spent $10,000 on sales and marketing in January and acquired 100 new customers, your CAC is $100.

You want your CAC to be lower than the lifetime value (LTV) of your customer. If your CAC is higher than LTV, you are spending more money acquiring customers than they are worth, which is not sustainable in the long run.

## Churn Rate

Churn rate is the percentage of customers who cancel their subscription in a given period. Tracking churn rate is critical because it directly impacts your MRR. 

To calculate churn rate, divide the number of customers who canceled in a given period by the number of total customers at the beginning of that period. For example, if you had 1,000 customers at the beginning of January and 50 customers canceled during the month, your monthly churn rate would be 5%.

Tracking churn rate can help you identify why customers are leaving and provide insight into areas where you need to improve. High churn rates can also negatively impact your business’s reputation and make it difficult to attract new customers.

## Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

Average revenue per user (ARPU) is the average amount of revenue generated by each customer in a given period. 

To calculate ARPU, divide your total revenue by the number of active customers in a given period. For example, if you had $100,000 in revenue in January and 1,000 active customers, your ARPU for that month would be $100.

Tracking ARPU can help you identify revenue trends among your customer base and determine areas where you can improve your pricing strategy.

## Lifetime Value (LTV)

Lifetime value (LTV) is the total amount of revenue you can expect to generate from a customer throughout their lifetime. 

To calculate LTV, multiply the average revenue per user (ARPU) by the average customer lifespan. For example, if your ARPU is $100 and your average customer lifespan is three years, your LTV would be $3,600.

Tracking LTV helps you understand the true value of your customers and make decisions on how much to spend on acquiring new customers.

## Magic Number

Magic number is a metric used to measure a company’s sales efficiency. It is calculated by dividing the growth in MRR by the sales and marketing expenses for that period. 

For example, if your MRR grew by $10,000 in January, and you spent $5,000 on sales and marketing in that period, your magic number would be 2. A magic number of 1 or greater indicates that your marketing spend is sufficient to generate positive revenue growth.

Using the magic number helps you allocate resources more efficiently and measure the effectiveness of your sales and marketing efforts.

## Burn Rate

Burn rate is the rate at which your business is spending money each month. It is important to track your burn rate to ensure you are not spending more than you are earning. 

To calculate burn rate, subtract your total expenses from your total revenue in a given period. For example, if you had $100,000 in total revenue and $80,000 in expenses in January, your burn rate for that month would be $20,000.

If your burn rate is higher than your revenue, you are burning through cash and need to take action to reduce expenses or increase revenue.

## Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net promoter score (NPS) is a metric used to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty. It is calculated based on responses to a single question: “How likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?”. 

Customers rate their likelihood on a scale of 0 to 10. Responses of 0-6 are considered detractors, 7-8 are considered passives, and 9-10 are considered promoters. 

To calculate NPS, subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. For example, if 40% of customers are promoters and 20% are detractors, your NPS would be 20.

Tracking NPS helps you identify areas where you need to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Conclusion

Tracking the right metrics is essential for building a successful SaaS business. The key metrics every SaaS founder should track include monthly recurring revenue (MRR), customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn rate, average revenue per user (ARPU), lifetime value (LTV), magic number, burn rate, and net promoter score (NPS). By understanding these metrics, you can make data-driven decisions, improve your business’s financial health, and maximize your chances of success.
