# Creating Shareable Content: Tips for Increasing Social Shares of Your Blog Posts

As a blogger, one of your main goals is to create content that your readers will love and share on their social media platforms. Social sharing can help drive more traffic to your blog, increase your followers, and ultimately grow your business. However, creating shareable content is easier said than done. In this post, we'll explore some tips and tricks for creating blog posts that people will want to share.

## Write Attention-Grabbing Headlines

The first step to creating shareable content is to write attention-grabbing headlines. A great headline is short, descriptive, and promises a benefit to the reader. It's also important to make your headline stand out from the rest. You can use numbers, questions, or emotional triggers to make your headline more appealing.

Avoid clickbait headlines that exaggerate the content or promise something that you can't deliver. Remember, the goal is not just to get clicks but to get people to read and share your content.

## Craft Quality Content

Once you have a great headline, it's time to focus on crafting quality blog content. Your blog post should be informative, engaging, and valuable to your readers. Use storytelling techniques to make your post more interesting and relatable. Add visuals such as images or videos to make your content more visually appealing.

When creating your blog post, remember to keep it scannable. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up your content and make it easier to read. Most people skim blog posts before reading them in detail, so it's crucial to create content that is easy to scan.

## Optimize for SEO

Optimizing your blog post for search engine optimization (SEO) is critical if you want to increase the chances of it being shared on social media. Make sure to include relevant keywords in your post's title, subheadings, and body. Use meta descriptions to give a brief overview of your post and encourage click-throughs from search engine results.

Use internal and external links in your post to improve its SEO value. Link to other relevant content on your blog or external sites that add value to your post. The more valuable your content is, the more likely it is to be shared on social media.

## Include Social Sharing Buttons

The easier it is for your readers to share your content, the more likely they are to do so. Make sure that your blog has social sharing buttons prominently displayed on the post. You can place them at the top or bottom of the post or use floating social sharing buttons that move with the reader as they scroll through the post.

Using social proof or social sharing counters can also help increase social shares. Social proof refers to the number of shares or likes a post has already received. Including social proof or sharing counters can encourage others to share your content as well.

## Share on Social Media

If you want your content to be shared on social media, you need to share it on your own social platforms first. Share your newly published post on your social media accounts and encourage your followers to share it as well. Use eye-catching visuals or pull quotes from your post to make your social media posts more interesting.

You can also join relevant Facebook groups or Twitter chats to share your content with like-minded individuals. Just make sure to read the group or chat's rules before posting to avoid being flagged as spam.

## Engage with Your Readers

Building a relationship with your readers is critical if you want them to share your content. Respond to comments on your blog posts and social media platforms. Ask your readers for feedback or suggestions for future posts. The more you engage with your readers, the more likely they are to share your content with their own followers.

## Optimize for Mobile

With more people accessing the internet on their mobile devices, it's essential to optimize your blog for mobile devices. Ensure that your blog is mobile-responsive and loads quickly on mobile devices. Use larger fonts and bigger images to make your content easier to read on smaller screens.

## Leverage Influencer Marketing

Influencer marketing can help increase the reach of your blog post and encourage more social shares. Reach out to influencers in your niche and ask them to share your post on their social media platforms. You can offer them a free product or service in exchange for promoting your post. Just make sure to choose influencers who have a strong following in your niche and whose audience aligns with your target audience.

## Final Thoughts

Creating shareable content takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end. The tips outlined above can help you create content that your readers will love and share on their social media platforms. Remember to write attention-grabbing headlines, craft quality content, optimize for SEO, include social sharing buttons, share on social media, engage with your readers, optimize for mobile, and leverage influencer marketing. With these strategies, you can increase social shares of your blog posts and grow your brand.
