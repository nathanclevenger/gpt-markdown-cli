## 1. Introduction to SaaS and Solopreneurs

Software as a Service (SaaS) refers to a cloud-based software distribution model where users access applications and services over the internet. This model has become popular due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of access, and scalability.

Solopreneurs, on the other hand, are solo entrepreneurs. These are individuals who run their businesses single-handedly, often without hiring employees. They handle everything from business development and marketing to customer service and product delivery.

SaaS and solopreneurship, when combined, can create powerful synergies. However, there are challenges that solopreneurs face in expanding their SaaS businesses, and AI has emerged as the game-changing solution to overcome these obstacles.
