## What is SaaS?

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model that allows users to access various software applications via the internet, eliminating the need for manual installation and updates. SaaS providers host their services on their own servers, allowing users to access their applications from anywhere, anytime. This subscription-based model has become increasingly popular because it offers a more cost-effective, scalable, and flexible solution for both businesses and consumers.

## What is a Solopreneur?

A solopreneur is an individual who establishes, manages, and operates a business on their own, without the aid of partners or employees. These self-driven individuals take on all roles and responsibilities within their businesses and rely on their own skills and expertise to thrive. In today's fast-paced digital world, solopreneurs are leveraging AI for SaaS to achieve success by multiplying their capabilities without extending their workforce.
