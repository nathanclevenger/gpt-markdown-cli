## 2. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI can be described as a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, designs, or patterns based on a specific set of inputs. In simpler terms, generative AI seeks to create new data that was not in existence before, but that still resembles the original data. This is done through various techniques such as deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. Some notable examples of generative AI are:

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These neural networks pit one network (generator) against another (discriminator) to generate content that appears as realistic as possible.

- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are generative models that learn the underlying probability distribution of a given dataset to produce new, similar data.

- Transformer Models: These are powerful models that can understand and generate text, which have played a significant role in the advancement of natural language processing (NLP). Their most famous implementation is OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
