For in the dark, failures often embrace

A glaring reminder that victory comes slow

No absolutes, no guarantee

In the realm of possibility

But timing, the seed that leads the way

Allows ventures to blossom, in due array

A talent honed, a skill refined

Timing prudently aligned

The entrepreneur learns to wield its sway

In glory's hour, success is won

Trials faced, battles done

But without the pulse of timing's hands

These victories would crumble, like shattered lands
