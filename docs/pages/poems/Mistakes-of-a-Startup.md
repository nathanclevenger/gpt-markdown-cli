**In a quaint town far, far away,**

## II. Mistakes Made

**Excited, the youth plotted a course,**

**To navigate the startup sea's discourse.**

**In the beginning, funds were steady,**

**A nest egg stored, the youth was ready.**

**No thought given to future days,**

**Money evaporated like morning haze.**

.

**A team assembled, talented, eager,**

**No clear leader nor trust in the bleachers.**

**Roles undefined, dysfunction ignited,**

**Communication weak, paths ununited.**

.

**Traction lulled, a vital component,**

**For growth and success to become potent.**

**Client acquisition staggered and slowed,**

**While marketing efforts remained in the cold.**

.

**Scaling too fast, out grew their slippers,**

**Dreamt of riches, unsure of figures.**

**Expansion seemed the way to thrive,**

**Yet hampered their young startup's drive. *}
