# From Bootstrap to Exit

### I. The Idea

A spark, a light, an ember's glow,
In halls of thought, the idea doth grow.
A vision bold of paths untrodden,
From bootstrap to exit, a startup's begotten.

In restless nights or sunlit morns,
In hallowed halls or caf√©s worn,
The entrepreneur's heart beats steady,
For creativity's dance, they are ever ready.

### II. The Birth

The pitch well-practiced, the race begins,
A founder's journey, the tides to swim.
From humble seeds, a mighty oak,
A startup born from fortune's stroke.

With ceaseless zeal, they rally,
A dream pursued, a chance to tally!
Innovation's sail unfurls with vigor,
To find the investors whose purse grows bigger.

### III. The Launch

Startup life, a whirlwind ride,
Success and failure, side by side.
Red lines holler, green lines cheer,
But the ship is sailing, no time for fear!

The office stews in heady chatter,
New ways to thrive, to climb the ladder.
Serendipity may be their friend,
But the entrepreneur will always bend.

### IV. The Grind

Each day a battle, each night a dream,
They push and pull, against the stream.
Hopes are shattered, and victories won,
Together they rise, the startup's song.

Coffee drained and keyboard struck,
Beneath the stars, they weave their clock.
The days blend in a haze of toil,
Mother Earth knows well their soil.

### V. The Scaling

Success! Alas, a welcome guest,
Their brilliant minds have passed the test!
With newfound vigor, they charge ahead,
Champions of change, courage is led.

The world takes notice, the tale unfolds,
A startup's journey from rags to gold.
To new horizons they will set,
From bootstrap beginnings to market vet.

### VI. The Exit

The end draws near, an exit looms,
For some, a blessing; for others, a tomb.
The legacy speaks for itself; it's built,
A tale of passion, courage, and guilt.

As new adventures call their name,
They stand tall, and play the game.
A founder's fire will never fade,
In their footsteps, the future is made.

From bootstrap to exit, the journey doth end,
But hearts they have touched, and lives they have mended.
For when a seed sprouts, and its roots dig deep,
An entrepreneur's legacy will live and keep.
