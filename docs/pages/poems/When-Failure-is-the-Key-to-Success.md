# When Failure is the Key to Success

_**I: The Dream**_

In the sleepless nights of the entrepreneur,
Where ambition churns and inspiration burns,
Emerge dreams of success and vogue allure,
To construct ideas from the cerebral whirlwind tour.

Here we dare to take our first breath,
To bring ideas into life, and life into death,
The courageous explorer of the Start-up Sea,
Steering our ship with strong, proud decree.

_**II: The Voyage**_

With sails unfurl and curiosity abound,
In eager search for new worlds to be found,
We race on the merciless waves of innovation,
Avoiding mediocrity's endless stagnation.

And through the storms of scrutiny we navigate,
Our sails of vision never tattering or abate,
For the winds of time whisper in our hearts,
A promise of glory, the goal towards which we dart.

_**III: The Disdain of Regret**_

But oh! There are moments when we feel the crush,
The weight of our choices and the gap of the rush,
The eternal question, *"What if I had taken the other road?"*,
Haunts us through every journey and every mile we rode.

Yet we must stay strong, unrelenting, and sure,
For regret is the poison that has no cure,
In the heart of a dreamer, it spins the webs of despair,
And robs us of our spirit to reach towards the air.

_**IV: The Embrace of Failure**_

We stumble, we falter, and sometimes we fall,
But no distant horizon turns against our call,
For failure, you see, is the great educator,
The bringer of wisdom, a catalyst for the creator.

And so with open arms, we welcome its caress,
For every failed leap, there's a lesson to possess,
Each setback a challenge, a question to ponder,
As we rise from the ashes and aboard once more wander.

_**V: The Triumph**_

And when success arrives with arms open wide,
As a warm embrace, whispering promises of an upward ride,
Remember, dear dreamer, the sweet taste of defeat,
For victories are hollow if not earned through fear and heat.

So we savor the fruits of our strife and toil,
The endless hours of bloodshed and turmoil,
For within each step, each stumble, and rise,
Lies the secretâ€”the success that never dies.

_**VI: The Lighthouse**_

Thus we stand, a beacon for the weary traveler,
A lesson that adversity is but fuel for fervor,
And when failure sprouts, casting darkness to unfold,
Embrace it with fortitude, and let the story be told.

For in the voyage of start-up's turbulent sea,
Every wave of struggle, shapes entrepreneurs to be free.
The end becomes the beginning, success retreating to start,
Failure the key to unlock triumph within the heart.
