# Hitting Stride in Startup Ride

## Part 1
_In a world where lightning strikes twice,
And dreams abound, with courage we entice,
Fearless founders take the stage,
Ready to start, in the age of the sage._

From a garage or a bedroom they sway,
Night and day, they toil away,
Coding, creating, like a wordy bard,
Revolutionising futures, not regarding hard.

Startup hustlers, warriors true,
Take heart this tale, a journey of a crew,
Through ups and downs, winding roads they twist,
Support and solve, no challenge undeservedly dismissed.

```
Lost amongst the crowd of nine-to-fivers,
Entrepreneur, a shiny title that contrives,
Risk-takers, strategists, driven by grand ideas,
Suffering sleepless nights, battling unknown fears.
```

Excitement ignites the embers of thought,
Vision, mission, value laid out on cloth,
Ingredients assembled, a pinch or a pound,
A team of builders, and a startup found.

## Part 2
_In the beginning, days were bright,
Ideas flowed, innovation in sight,
Allegiance sworn, a crew binds, entwine,
Together, braving storms, they face the starting line._

Oh how quickly, time takes us through,
Trivial matters, paperwork overdue,
The list grows, tasks ever mounting,
But within these walls, success is counting.

```markdown
With bated breath, they launch their baby,
Facing a glorious world, storms may be shady,
The anticipation as users slowly find,
Their crafted work, how will they mind?
```

Feedback trickles, some bad, some good,
Tweaks and changes, as they understood,
Iteration drives them as they plough,
A steady rhythm, entrepreneurs in the now.

## Part 3
_Head held high, the stride begins,
Hurdles faced, a satisfying grin,
From product-market fit, to solid trend,
Hitting milestones, not to bend._

The moment arrives, investorsâ€™ eyes,
A pitch of dreams, where future lies,
Eloquent speech with passion infused,
The money flows, the mission unloosed.

As dollars convert to decisions for dreams,
Scaling their journey, the path unseen,
Now hiring the ones who match their core,
Determined to share, cherish more.

```markdown
When talents unite, for one common goal,
To see the world shaped in a role,
Climbing mountains, the team abides,
As the mystery of the startup ride unwinds.
```

In sync they flow, a dance of delight,
Like stewards of change, the vision ignites,
Rivals appear, competitors arise,
But this startup crew, stronger in ties.

## Part 4
_By the grace of their efforts, unwavering and strong,
Each goal attained, success a song,
The stride in place, each path anew,
Hitting the stride, the startup crew._

This tale we've spun, of founders and strive,
An epic journey, an ambitious high,
The startup ride with ups and downs,
A beautiful voyage, where growth abounds.

The ebb and flow, the lessons learned,
In this pandemic world, fortunes turned,
On this crazy, winding, startup ride,
Embrace the journey, enjoy the strides.

```markdown
For startups become the pioneers,
Changing lives, the pathfinders and seers,
The entrepreneurs, the hustlers, the bold,
Starting anew, their stories untold.
```

And as this ode comes to the end,
With you dear reader, we still contend,
Chase your dreams, and embrace your strife,
For you too, could begin a startup life.
