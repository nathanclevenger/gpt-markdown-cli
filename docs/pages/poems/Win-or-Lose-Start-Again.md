# Win or Lose, Start Again

*Verse 1*

As dawn breaks and a new day starts to shine,

The entrepreneur stirs, eyes wide, dreams to bind.

A thirst to create, a flame that burns bright,

In the realm of startups, their spirits alight.

With hope in their hearts, they venture anew,

To conjure ideas, boundless and true.

Though many may falter and some see defeat,

Embarking again, they will not concede.



*Verse 2*

Oh startups, those vessels of vision and whimsy,

Built ouf of courage, and bound by tenacity.

To take on the giants, to break through the fog,

They must strive and struggle, traversing the slog.

In a land of chaos, they enter the fray,

A passing storm, they'll not be swept away.



*Chorus*

Win or lose, start again, they believe,

In the face of failure, their souls won't seethe.

Uncertainty's shadow casts not its pallor,

On these heroes, with passion akin to valor.

For they know that greatness lies on the morrow,

Within triumphs and trials borne of their sorrow.



*Verse 3*

In pursuit of the bold, where the path's undefined,

Honing instincts and wit, they're armed and refined.

Silent whispers of doubts may tiptoe around,

But through grit and resolve, they'll stand their ground.

They heed not the taunts, the naysayers' sneer,

Their eyes on the horizon, purpose crystal clear.

Firm in their stance, deaf to the noise,

These startups wear dreams as their armor of choice.



*Verse 4*

With fire within, they defy all constraint,

Ignite the landscape, fueled with color and paint.

With ideas untamed, they exude might,

Drawing from wellsprings of inspiration's light.

Fierce in mission, relentless in zeal,

Each failure, they wear as a badge of appeal.



*Chorus*

Win or lose, start again, they believe,

In the face of failure, their souls won't seethe.

Uncertainty's shadow casts not its pallor,

On these heroes, with passion akin to valor.

For they know that greatness lies on the morrow,

Within triumphs and trials borne of their sorrow.



*Bridge*

Even on a road that winds and abates,

Their spirits soar high, unshackled by fate.

Through swells of setbacks and valleys of gloom,

Demise gives way to new ventures abloom.

Cloaked in resilience, they face every defeat,

Shedding the past, with each failure they meet.



*Verse 5*

Day turns to dusk, as the hours unwind,

As weary heads bow, dreams flicker and bind.

With fire undaunted, they drift off to sleep,

As slumber restores the strength that they keep.

Ready for another venture, a fresh day to start,

To mold dreams anew, secure in their heart.



*Chorus (Repeat)*

Win or lose, start again, they believe,

In the face of failure, their souls won't seethe.

Uncertainty's shadow casts not its pallor,

On these heroes, with passion akin to valor.

For they know that greatness lies on the morrow,

Within triumphs and trials borne of their sorrow.
