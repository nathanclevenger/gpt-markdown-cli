# Startup Sins

## I

With bated breath, my tale begins,
Of ventures, risks, and startup sins.
Lend me your ear, attentive crowd,
In rhymed verse, my song resounds.

## II

Amidst the chaos and the din,
A fervent brood gave birth to spin
A web of visions, goals, and dreams,
To sail the seas of startup streams.

## III

Their journey fraught with trials and tests,
An ardent quest for the very best,
They charted courses, mapped stars above,
And fueled their ship with ceaseless love.

## IV

But ne’ertheless, for all their guile,
This boldest crew bore eerie smile,
A chosen path with much confusion,
Doomed to face many an illusion.

## V

Now gather close and learn from woe,
To not deceive, nor blindly go,
Into the coils of errors stark,
That haunts the startup's ceaseless spark.

## VI

Excessive zeal, a common sin,
Ambition’s grip may soon begin,
To hasten and to overwhelm,
The gentle sway of steering helm.

## VII

Nor scarce their goal, the founder's vow,
To seek success and riches now,
But blinded are so many schemes,
By thoughts of gain and empty dreams.

## VIII

_Innovation_, golden word,
To have adorned so many heard,
Yet, heed it well, this solemn warning,
Pursue it not in thoughtless mourning.

## IX

To innovate, to trap the winds,
One must be skilled in more than whims,
See not in venture this alone,
So many aspects must be honed.

## X

To build a team of talents vast,
From makers to the roles diverse,
An all-important quest top rank,
Takes ample time with great thanks.

## XI

Yet, oft it is that those enthused,
In what's so taught in eager youth,
May trust too much in burning souls,
And fail to see their glaring holes.

## XII

No fiery passion guarantees,
That all shall give of their bread and cheese,
A balance find ‘tween burning flame,
And grounded skills, to win the game.

## XIII

The market's whims and shifting sands,
Not always tread as hoped or planned,
A startup sin woeful to tell,
Ignorance of clientele.

## XIV

To know thy craft, it's not enough,
For faceless patrons, demand's tough,
One mustn't flout their cares and pain,
Whose coin doth bind, and value gained.

## XV

Amidst the rush to grow and rise,
To scale the heights and seize the skies,
No sin perhaps conceals from start,
Like lack of focus in one's art.

## XVI

Distraction knocks at every door,
In clamor's awe, the mind unsure,
To hold in sight the path unknown,
To keep the sails directed strong.

## XVII

For to succeed, and not just sail,
One scarce can dip the shallow tail,
But delve the depths of truer calling,
And not fear to stand forth, headlong.

## XVIII

Hear now, the final startup sin,
From which so many fail to spring,
The curse of dreamers, filled and noble,
Inaction, shacklings, unstart goal.

## XIX

To act, to strive, despite the odds,
Embark fierce currents, silencing naysay gods,
To overcome the sins ingrained,
The courage rare in some is strained.

## XX

So thus, dear travelers of pursuit,
I hope this verse hath touched your roots,
And that, bequeathed you, in turn, a vision,
To tame perils with prudent precision.

## XXI

In tally, friends, we heed seven sins,
By which startups oft begin,
Heed not their call, nor reckless trace,
Pursue the righteous path with grace.
