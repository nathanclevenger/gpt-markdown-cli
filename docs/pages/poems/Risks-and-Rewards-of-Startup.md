# Risks and Rewards of Startup

## Verse 1:
```
To journey through the land of Start,
A tale of triumph, and of heart.
We venture forth to realms unknown,
Braving the wild, the seeds now sown.

With dreams and passions as our guide,
Undeterred by storms, we'll never hide.
Oh Startup Life, an anthem stitched,
Our nights, our days, forever hitched.
```

## Verse 2:
```
Into the fray, we dive head-first,
Fueled by a thirst we cannot quench,
Entrepreneurs, brave and bold,
Seeking treasures more than gold.

Risks and Rewards, our eternal quest,
Refining ideas, pursuing the best.
Traveling deep into the night,
Scribbling thoughts, our visions ignite.
```

## Verse 3:
```
Oh, the risks, they are plenty,
From wayside tuÂ°urns, there are many.
Trials, doubts and pitfalls wide,
From stormy seas, to shores untried.

But the rewards, oh how they gleam,
In these endless hours we dare to dream.
The spark of hope, the taste of success,
Our yearning hearts, they won't rest.
```

## Verse 4:
```
May fortunes favor the trail we pave,
Encompassing valleys and mountain caves.
Past tangled forests, we'll find our way,
And seize the chance at a brighter day.

Amidst the tumult, one truth remains,
Our need to build, to conquer, to gain.
In startups, we find solace and strength,
Chasing dreams, no matter the length.
```

## Verse 5:
```
Rewards we dote on, with promises lush,
Stakeholders pleased, the market a flush.
Profits and progress, the sweetest allure,
The Entrepreneur's dream, a pathway secure.

Striving to carve a niche far and wide,
At the glorious end, no need to hide.
Our creations shall bloom, this much is true,
As long as spirit and drive remain anew.
```

## Verse 6:
```
Startup Life, we sing thy praise,
What once was dark and hidden, we now raise.
Risks, rewards, lay scattered like stars,
Enduring trials, to proudly bear our scars.

To venture forth, oh kings and queens,
Our tales shall be woven, the fabric of dreams.
Together as one, journeying through night,
The Risks and Rewards of Startup, our eternal delight.
