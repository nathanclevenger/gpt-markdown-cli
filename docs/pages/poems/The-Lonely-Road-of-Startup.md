# The Lonely Road of Startup

_In a world where success needs no passport,_  
_Enter with me the realm of the startup,_  
_A journey, brave, but not always met with reward,_  
_Take heed as we roam the lonely startup road._

## I: A Dream is Born

In a whirlwind of ideas and might,  
A lone entrepreneur burns the midnight oil,  
Fueled by passion and a vision so bright,  
In pursuit of a future plucked from realms of toil.

Oh the path paved by those before,  
Tales of success, fame, and grand fortune,  
Calls forth those dreamers, daring and more,  
To cast their lot and join the mighty legion.

## II: The Dawn of Strife

The days grow long in the founder's fight,  
As tasks abound, and resources scarce to allot,  
Battles waged, one by one, day and night,  
For the birth of an empire must earned and not bought.

And through the doubts and darkness fraught,  
A resilient fire burns deep within,  
A steadfast resolve, lessons often taught,  
The lonely road demands the will to win.

## III: A Gathering Storm

No fledgling venture a course alone can chart,  
A team of warriors must take to the fray,  
Each with their strengths and skills a part,  
Fuel for the journey, the long shadows at bay.

And as the storm gathers strength, and skies grow dark,  
The resilient few forge aheadundeterred,  
Each challenge met, a necessary mark,    
Their harmony an armor, their startup, a fortress secured.

## IV: The Price of Passage

The weary one falls to their knees,  
For even the strong have their limits,  
The road lined with temptation, a false reprieve,  
Beware the vices that sway and pivot.

Oh the price of passage, what may it cost?  
A life of balance, wrecked asunder.  
A mighty ocean, the brave must cross,  
Steering thy ship past failure's thunder

## V: Echoes of Promise

Yet, through the storms and strife untold,  
A beacon of hope on the horizon dawns,  
Success and fortune, it glimmers like gold.  
The spoils of the tireless, await beyond yonder.

The pulse of promise, felt far and wide,  
Speaks to the souls of those who sought,  
An endless passion, flowing like a tide,  
The fuel for victory to be bought.

## VI: The Summit of Glory

And as battle-scarred warriors climb the height,  
The summit of glory at last emerged,  
With trembling hearts, they embrace the sight,  
Of dreams and fortunes wholly converged.

For those who tread the lonely road,  
A truth's revealed, earned only in time,  
The spoils reserved for those who strode,  
Through fiery trials, both torrent and clime.

_Unyielding and steadfast, in purpose and deed,_  
_This, the lonely road of startup, leads,_  
_For those who traverse the uncertain path,_  
_The rewards shall be met in the aftermath._

And as the sun sets, and you lay to rest,  
On the path you've carved in pursuit of your quest,  
Find solace in knowing you're among a few,  
Who dared defy odds, and venture anew.
