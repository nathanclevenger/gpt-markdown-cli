# Starting Small, Dreaming Big

```
Stanza 1
```
Born from an idea, a tiny spark,
An ember that glows in the dark,
Starting small with a dream so big,
Building and weaving, it is our gig.

```
Stanza 2
```
Gathered around a table of tales,
Creating, crafting, courageous sails,
Together we stand, in our small group,
A team ready to face every hoop.

```
Stanza 3
```
Late nights, fueled by coffee and thought,
Early mornings, when dreaming is sought,
Empowering each other, we dare,
To change the world, with love, and care.

```
Stanza 4
```
Folks around us, they doubt with ease,
But we learn to sway, just like the breeze,
Through ups and downs, we forge together,
A bond that withstands every weather.

```
Stanza 5
```
We start small, hidden away,
While dreaming big, we pave the way,
To grow, to thrive, to scale the skies,
We soar high, like eagles with wide eyes.

```
Stanza 6
```
Creating a product, our pride and joy,
Innovation at its core, we deploy,
Delivering value, touching lives,
We do not falter, for we always strive.

```
Stanza 7
```
Launching into the market, bold,
A start-up story, gradually unfold,
The culmination of our sweat and tears,
The passion ablaze, conquering fears.

```
Stanza 8
```
Success and failure, they intertwine,
A tapestry of colors that shines,
In time we learn, adapt and evolve,
Breaking boundaries, solving problems unsolved.

```
Stanza 9
```
Impacting the world, one step at a time,
An uphill climb, a mountain to rhyme,
Success isn't the only objective,
A small start-up, it is quite selective.

```
Stanza 10
```
We choose the path, less traveled, they say,
For we believe, there is no other way,
The world is vast, but we know our place,
To create wonders and represent our space.

```
Stanza 11
```
Our achievements, the silent victory,
For every milestone, deserves a story,
We'll keep dreaming big, as we grow,
Scaling heights, where others fear to go.

```
Stanza 12
```
In time, what started small and new,
Will become a name, respected and true,
A legacy built, we'll pass along,
A testament for generations to thong.

```
Stanza 13
```
As we walk the path, the journey well worn,
Weaved in the fabric, the start-up's born,
Remember the dreams, from which we started,
Embrace every lesson, imparted.

```
Stanza 14
```
For in the end, it is not just about us,
But the impact we leave, without a fuss,
The world we create and the lives we touch,
The small beginnings, that matter much.

```
Stanza 15
```
So, here we stand, our dream in sight,
Starting small, but dreaming big, right,
For every heart, that beats in sync,
We tread forward, on this start-up brink.
