# Startup Code

[Verse 1]

Once upon a time secluded in a den,

Entrepreneurs were gathered with a plan.

To create a venture we all admire,

But little did they know the challenges prior.

<br>

[Verse 2]

With ideas brewing and excitement to fence,

They typed some code and business commenced.

Input and output, and errors galore,

But they pushed through the stress and craved for more.

<br>

[Verse 3]

Their days were long, and the nights sometimes tough,

But the fire in their souls made worries seem bluff.

Python, Ruby, C++, and so,

A language symphony played all crescendo.

<br>

[Verse 4]

Version control and iterative release,

Embraced collaboration and increased its peace.

An MVP to test and to demonstrate,

The potential value their creation could make.

<br>

[Verse 5]

Some talked of Java, others Swift, some even F#

With Stack Overflow as their treasured map.

Their browsers overflowed with tabs untold,

Emboldened seeking answers to problems they now hold.

<br>

[Chorus]

The startup code, behind the scenes,

A game of wits, and unbreakable dreams.

Where tycoon hearts and unicorn visions,

Assemble the future with purpose-driven incisions.

<br>

[Verse 6]

A playful challenge, a code review class,

Ensured that quality did never pass.

And testing sessions, bugs to fix,

Gave moments of joy when things seemed amiss.

<br>

[Verse 7]

DevOps, nomads, and designers too,

A colorful palette of skills in their crew.

Sales and marketing, spreading the word,

The startup dream taking wing like a bird.

<br>

[Verse 8]

Agile and lean, a mantra they praise,

Scrum boards and sprints helped keep the haze.

Retrospective meetings and demos to share,

Their progress, achievements, and value laid bare.

<br>

[Verse 9]

Data analysis, making sense of facts,

Decision trees and predictive models they enact.

Every decision tailored to the market’s desire,

Customer feedback the wind beneath their higher.

<br>

[Verse 10]

A blend of talent from far and near,

A myriad of cultures, yet camaraderie so clear.

A startup culture molds them all,

Each one essential in the collective sprawl.

<br>

[Chorus]

The startup code, behind the scenes,

A game of wits, and unbreakable dreams.

Where tycoon hearts and unicorn visions,

Assemble the future with purpose-driven incisions.

<br>

[Verse 11]

Investors discern, each weighing pros and cons,

Risk and reward, like olden songs.

The pitch deck flawless, financials tight,

To secure much-needed capital and ignite.

<br>

[Verse 12]

Legal matters, patents amassed,

Structure to safeguard and portfolio vast.

The corporate fabric and governance construct,

Inspired confidence and stakeholders to instruct.

<br>

[Verse 13]

Mistakes were made, yet lessons attained,

A treasure trove of wisdom eventually unchained.

Challenges faced with unparalleled grit,

Even when admitting a pivot was fit.

<br>

[Verse 14]

A nurturing hub for minds ambitious,

Incubators aided and provided good wishes.

Mentors they sought and advice they took,

In their startup journey, determined no crook.

<br>

[Verse 15]

Rejection, tears, and uphill fails,

Paved the path for personal tales.

Underneath the stories of fame and cheer,

The startup code was ultimately dear.

<br>

[Chorus]

The startup code, behind the scenes,

A game of wits, and unbreakable dreams.

Where tycoon hearts and unicorn visions,

Assemble the future with purpose-driven incisions.

<br>

[Verse 16]

And when success was met, and their million-plan bloomed,

Grateful and humble, they received acclaim unassumed.

In their hearts, they knew the work’s not complete,

A lifetime of endeavors, a never-ending feast.

<br>

[Outro]

So let's applaud the journey of those before,

Their passion and strife, we cannot ignore.

The startup life will try and it'll mend,

But remember the code, the ultimate friend.

The startup code, behind the scenes...
