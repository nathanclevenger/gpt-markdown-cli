# Starting Over

## I. The Awakening
Here, in the depths of our dreams, we lie,  
As restless souls longing for the sky  
To break the chains that held us to our desires,  
And release our spirit from the burning fires.  

Once more, we turn the pages back  
To rectify the wrongs that made us slack.  
A new beginning dawns in the heart of the dawn,  
As the sun erases the scars so worn.  

```
Chorus:  
Oh, starting over, a song that begins anew,  
A tale of start-ups, through and through  
Destinies shaped by the hands of the brave,  
Built on the knowledge that they must save.  
```

## II. The Vision

With eyes wide open and hearts set alight,  
We breathe life into visions that we might  
Paddle the boat through the currents of change  
As we sail towards our dreams, broad and strange.  

Seeking out knowledge, we find the truth;  
The crest waves of success hold no ruth.  
Every victory counts, both big and small,  
As long we learn and rise above all.  

```
Chorus:  
Oh, starting over, a song that begins anew.  
A tale of start-ups, through and through.  
Destinies shaped by the hands of the brave,  
Built on the knowledge that they must save.  
```

## III. The People

Surrounded by likeminded souls we stand,  
Singing the melodies of a different land  
Interwoven dreams, a tapestry of hope,  
Together we'll find a way to cope.  

United in purpose, fostering bonds,  
We forge connections that go beyond  
The realm of mere money and rewards,  
For every encounter, an experience hoards.  

```
Chorus:  
Oh, starting over, a song that begins anew,  
A tale of start-ups, through and through,  
Destinies shaped by the hands of the brave,  
Built on the knowledge that they must save.  
```

## IV. Trials and Triumphs

With every storm that passes, we grow  
Stronger, adapting as the winds blow.  
On the mountain high of our dreams, we climb,  
Bracing against the hardships of time.  

Learning from failure, refining our course,  
We tread towards the north of success, no remorse.  
Flexibility and grit, radiant in our eyes,  
Believing in ourselves with each sunrise.  

```
Chorus:  
Oh, starting over, a song that begins anew,  
A tale of start-ups, through and through,  
Destinies shaped by the hands of the brave,  
Built on the knowledge that they must save.  
```

## V. The Reckoning

Scaling the heights, we've reached our goal,  
But the journey's end is not the sole  
Destination that we sought, but rather  
The path of growth, wisdom to gather.  

So revel in the achievements, high and mighty,  
Carry lessons learned, mindful and wistful, sightly.  
For the triumphs sweet and bitter, a tale spun,  
Remembering that the road is never done.  

```
Chorus:  
Oh, starting over, a song that begins anew,  
A tale of start-ups, through and through,  
Destinies shaped by the hands of the brave,  
Built on the knowledge that they must save.  
```

## Finale: The Legacy

Embarking on yet another voyage anew,  
We look back once more, acknowledging the hue  
Of battles fought and victories won,  
A tapestry of our story just begun.  

Passing the torch to those who follow,  
We leave the mark of our legacy, allow  
The seeds of knowledge, inspiration to sow,  
Our beloved start-ups to thrive and grow.  

```
Chorus:  
Oh, starting over, a song that begins anew,  
A tale of start-ups, through and through,  
Destinies shaped by the hands of the brave,  
Built on the knowledge that they must save.
