# The Startup Spark

* * * 

## I

As the break of dawn approaches near,  
New ideas do appear;  
Thoughts of innovation ignite the sphere,  
The startup spark, we hold so dear.

An enterprising journey so divine,  
Where success begins to form a line;  
A team of dreamers who dare to chase,  
A path of growth and a life of grace.

## II

In a world that moves at lightning speed,  
Seeking harmony in every creed;  
Pacing forth in the pursuit of change,  
Startup lives that we rearrange.

Creativity fuels our progress' rail,  
For passion guides as we set sail;  
Guided by an ardent desire,  
The startup spark ignites its fire.

## III

Data and analytics inform our way,  
As rationales fortify our play;  
Measuring growth as our goals align,  
The story of progress seeks to intertwine.

And as we commence, we wear our hats,  
Entrepreneurial spirit dwells where we sat;  
In the midst of it all, a fervent peak,  
The startup spark that we must seek.

## IV

Sprouting forth from a modest seed,  
Surely to prevail, to grow, to lead;  
And in the hearts of those who come behind,  
A startup life theyâ€™re sure to find.

Adapting fast to the times that change,  
Exploring avenues yet unclaimed;  
The path of learning, no end in sight,  
The startup spark's illuminating light.

## V

We gather around the table's edge,  
United in purpose, a common pledge;  
The spirit of collaboration does embolden,  
A startup tale that must be told in.

Bound by the drive to make an impact,  
A choice of love, not just a pact;  
Through long nights and countless hours,  
A single spark that blooms to flowers.

## VI

Celebrating wins along the way,  
Innovation trails the path, we sway;  
Translating visions into reality,  
The startup spark is boundless, free.

Unbounded by the existential grind,  
The power to build unique designs;  
Imbued with an effervescent zest,  
For one and all to manifest.

## VII

Endearing listeners, cease to rest,  
Join this journey to bequest;  
Leave your tides to cultivate,  
A startup life that does await.

For now it's time to wear the cloak,  
And dare to dream, to think, to stroke;  
Embrace the challenge, never part,  
The startup spark within your heart.
