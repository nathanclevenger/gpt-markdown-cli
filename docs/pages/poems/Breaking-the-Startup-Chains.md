# Breaking the Startup Chains

### I

*Oh, the startup life it beckons, all minds afresh and new,*

*A symphony that resonates with dreams, an anthem true.*

*But bound within those iv'ry walls, where businesses are born,*

*Lies tangled webs, oppressive weight, and often, hearts forlorn.*

---

### II

*As I sit upon this silv'ry cloud of fleeting, fickle chance,*

*The swirling twists of fortune's waves I hope to learn to dance.*

*For in the start, a mirage shone, a golden pathway free,*

*But soon it fades to darkling seas, the path enfolds on me.*

---

### III

*The shackles groan, the chains they clatter, in the midnight hour bleak,*

*The price to pay, to innovate, enslave the strong and weak.*

*From dawn to dusk, from dusk to dawn, a cycle none can break,*

*It carries on, this endless song, of sacrifice, I stake.*

---

### IV

*With weary eyes, and hearts a-pounding, passion turns to fear,*

*Yet on we strive, our faces smil'ng, visions crystal clear.*

*For e'en though chains entwine and bind within this realm so young,*

*From deep within, me thinks, "What if?" a plaintive cry, unsung.*

---

### V

*With words coherent, tales of funding, fees and capital,*

*Some lose their way, enticed by wealth and shackled to the fall.*

*For easy glitt'ring spoils may come, but as a gilded cage,*

*An anguished cry, a soul distraught, enchains the bright of age.*

---

### VI

*Still, bound within these walls of hope, entangled in their dreams,*

*The entrepreneur soars higher, into forging streams.*

*Amidst the winds of change they learn, the art of letting go,*

*To break the chains, to find release, and bask in sunlight's glow.*

---

### VII

*What solace lies within these hearts that dare to break the mold,*

*To venture forth where angels fear, and world's distress unfold?*

*Oh, courage springs, as rock steadfast, inferno ign'rant, strong,*

*A will so fierce to cleanse these chains, to rectify the throngs.*

---

### VIII

*Innovation blooms in riv'lets, growing ever strong,*

*Ascending high, where Phoebus calls, to new horizons drawn.*

*By night reposed, a balm descends, upon the weary souls,*

*To unwind the chains, with each caress, and mend the gory holes.*

---

### IX

*Oh, proud the founders wear the scars of battles won and lost,*

*Of lessons learned, of darkened nights, and dreams that bear a cost.*

*Within each heart, a fervent calm, a strength, a mission clear,*

*To break the chains, an opera in crescendo, bold, sincere.*

---

### X

*'Tis but a fleeting moment brief, of sweetest, fragrant peace,*

*A respite born to mend the heart, and let the spirit cease.*

*The song of breaking startup chains, a serenade of hope,*

*In pursuit of dreams, delays and strains, victorious, we'll cope.*
