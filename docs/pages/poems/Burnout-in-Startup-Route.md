# Burnout in Startup Route

## I. A Pirate's Start

Aboard this startup ship my friend, with sails unfurled, we go,
We venture through the hurricane, for dreams that we don't know,
Our compass spins, a whirlwind whirs, direction we must choose,
We're pirate founders on this route, with much so much to lose.

Oh founders in this startup route where night blends into day,
We stumble, fall, and pick ourselves, our chaos under sway,
We don the mask that startup wears, with vigor seldom seen,
Of endless nights and sleepless days, as dreams and heart we wean.

## II. To Chart the Stars

We strive to chart the universe of data, code, and more,
But lightning strikes and thunder claps, our logic's swept ashore,
The burnout ship that sails the route, it's caught within the gale,
As rumors spread of valiant fights, we balance on this pale.

The stars that guide our weary eyes, they tell us where to be,
Yet walls we hit and breathe we lack, despair we cannot free,
A thousand docks we sought to pass, and in search lights we hope,
That lantern swayed to guide us through, to startups golden scope.

## III. The Founders' Gloom

Yet oft we meet upon this route, a crowded narrowing street,
With startups, pirates by the scores, like us their fate to meet,
And shadows cast upon the lane in cracks of light and dark,
Reveal the strain, a twisted path, we carry in our heart.

The cloudy skies of burnout loom, we cannot seem to rest,
In days we push and nights we pull, our sanity to test,
A blinding fog ahead unfurls, unsure if we'll succeed,
Our path obscured by doubts and woes, as founders on this steed.

## IV. The Treasure Skein

Ah, but now a fleeting glimpse, of treasure hidden clear,
The promise and the hopes that line, the chest that we hold dear,
And with each turn we take the step, with visions grand we dream,
Of influence, success, and wealth, as far as one could scream.

But often in this race for gold, to chase that golden goose,
The treasure found or not at all, it slips and slides, and woos,
Yet on and on, we chase the skein; a muse, a drug, we fight,
And burnout in our desperate search, for fame and gain's delight.

## V. Slow Down, That Hope Be Found

Now a voice whispers through the storm, a voice we know so well,
"Slow down, hold fast," it speaks, as soft as tales we tell,
Take shelter from this storm we're in, a respite that we need,
To find the heart that once we had, the essence that we breed.

For if we can't refill the well, we'll always be running dry,
And burnout in our startup route, shall be our final cry,
As founders, we endure the end, unless we find a way,
To heal and love ourselves within the oceans vast array.

## VI. The Founders' Elysium

A sunrise beckons, breaking dawn, the skies shall clear no doubt,
The seas subside, the winds they wane; the storm, it breathes out,
This ship we sail, this crew we have, shall find its way in truth,
Reborn, refueled, renewed we are, a lighthouse in the route.

In Elysium, we shall dwell, yet back to storms we'll come,
But stronger shall we face them then, no longer burnout runs,
For founder we may be, it’s true, our startup in this route,
With wisdom from this journey’s twists, sought pearls that we found out.
