# The Spark of Startup Life

There's a spark that ignites within,
When you start on a journey, a new begin.
A fire deep inside that fuels the soul,
Enabling us to settle, never to cajole.

For those who choose such a path,
It's not for the faint of heart,
One needs the courage to forge ahead,
And pursue this journey from the start.

The spark is what moves us forward,
In the face of every challenge,
It gives us the strength to push on,
And never to avenge.

Every entrepreneur knows what it's like,
To be riddled with doubt and fear,
It strikes from every angle,
And doesn’t seem to disappear.

But it's that spark that keeps us going,
When the odds are stacked against us,
It's the driving force behind the effort,
That turns our small idea into a huge success.

With every piece of progress we make,
The flame inside us glows,
And the spark grows stronger each day,
As we build a business from small to great.

It's that spark that attracts like-minded people,
Who share the same vision and passion,
And together they form an unstoppable force,
Creating out of nothing a great emporium.

Each obstacle is just another chance,
To let the spark shine bright,
To take on new challenges,
And make things right.

The spark of startup life,
Takes us to places we never thought we’d gone,
It leads us down paths where we find a new truth,
And we look back on what we've done.

The startup life can be a lonely road,
Filled with long days and nights,
But the spark inside us keeps burning,
Through the hard times and the fights.

Inspiring us to take the plunge,
And make our dream a reality,
Encouraging us to keep pushing,
Until we reach success with modesty.

For those who venture into this path,
And take on this journey of their own,
Keep the spark that ignites your soul,
And know that we are never alone.

For every person who has embarked,
On the journey of start-up life,
May your spark keep on burning bright,
Leading you to a future with perfect vibes.
