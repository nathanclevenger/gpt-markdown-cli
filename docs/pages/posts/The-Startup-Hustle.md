# The Startup Hustle

From garages and dorm rooms,
Ideas bloom and take roots.
Racing towards the marketplace,
Building new and untold routes.

The startup hustle, it’s a game,
It’s a race against the clock.
Investors, customers, and partners,
All waiting for your grand unlock.

You’ve got passion, you’ve got drive,
A vision like no other.
You’re the leader, the pioneer,
Your startup’s like none other.

From pivots to long hours,
You’ve sacrificed everything.
But it’s all worth it, when you see
Your startup truly thriving.

The grind, the hustle, the startup life,
It’s not for the faint of heart.
But for those who dare to dream big,
Their journey is just about to start.

Funding rounds and pitch decks,
MVPs and KPIs.
Scaling and growth are the goals,
The startup hustle never dies.

From failures and tough times,
To success and promises fulfilled.
The startup journey is a rollercoaster,
But it’s worth it, take our word.

So here’s to the startup life,
Full of risks, hurdles, and gain.
May your hustle be relentless,
May your vision never wane.

From garages and dorm rooms,
To big offices and grand success.
The startup hustle never stops,
It’s a thrilling and wild process.

So go forth, fellow hustlers,
With your startup dreams ahead.
The road may be long and tough,
But with passion, nothing goes unsaid.
