# The Startup Sprint

We run this race, this startup sprint  
Through valleys low and summits mint  
We build our dreams upon the ground  
Of trials met and woes unfound  

We start with naught but just an idea  
A glint of hope, a sense of fear  
No roadmap clear, no guarantee  
Just endless work, we'll soon foresee  

The market's winds may blow and spin  
And catch us short, or let us win  
Our sails will flex and stretch with might  
As we adjust and navigate our flight  

We'll brand our startup with great care  
Our value prop, our different share  
We'll hone our pitch and tweak our deck  
And make the case, we won't be a wreck  

We'll hustle hard, we'll pound those stones  
We'll grind each day, we'll send those drones  
We'll pierce the veil of all opponents  
With stealth and smarts and dev components  

We'll raise some funds, we'll take some risks  
We'll learn to pivot, we'll pump our fists  
We'll hire talent, we'll build our team  
We'll cheer our wins, we'll own our dream  

We'll code our MVP, we'll ship it fast  
We'll ask for feedback, we'll leverage our past  
We'll iterate, we'll make it better  
We'll nail the product, we'll be no debtor  

We'll stand up tall, we'll pitch and sell  
We'll cross that chasm, we'll ring that bell  
We'll high five our customers old and new  
We'll scale our startup, we'll make it true  

And when we reach the finish line  
We'll take a breath, we'll say "we're fine"  
For all we've done and all we've taken  
Has been worth the joy and pain we've waken  

So cheers to all, who dare to try  
To all who build, to all who fly  
To all who dream, to all who cherish  
The startup life, we'll never perish!
