# The Startup Dream

Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city,
A dream glimmers, bright and pretty.
Of a world where ideas come to life,
And anything is possible with just strife.

It's the dream of the startup life,
The one where we build from strife.
A world where passion meets a need,
And all we do is simply succeed.

With just a few dollars and a computer,
We can bring innovation like never before.
We hustle, we grind, and we never stop,
Till our ideas have reached the very tippy top.

We pitch to investors, we pitch to friends,
We pitch to anyone who'll listen till the end.
We sell our vision, we sell our goals,
We paint the picture of the startup soul.

It's the rush of turning nothing into something,
Of seeing a vision become a functioning string.
We take risks, we make bets,
We never shy away from the unknowns and debts.

We create a family, a team of like minds,
Where talent and passion are the only kinds.
We work long hours, we work hard,
Our goal is always to bring it to the yard.

The startup life is like no other,
It's a journey that leads to forever.
We innovate, we shape, we change,
We make the impossible, possible, and rearrange.

It's the pulse of the city, the beating heart,
The startup dream is a work of art.
We strive for greatness, for the top of the heap,
Our vision and passion is what we reap.

And it's the dream we dream with open eyes,
The one where we reach for the skies.
So we build, we create, we innovate,
Till the startup dream becomes our fate.
