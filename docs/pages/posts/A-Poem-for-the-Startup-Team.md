# A Poem for the Startup Team

Oh startup team, so brave and bold
With hearts of steel, and minds of gold
You work each day to build a dream
A vision grand, a sparkling scheme

Through sleepless nights and hectic days
You push ahead in countless ways
Your passion drives you ever on
A force that can't be lost or gone

The road is long, the path is steep
The journey hard, the way not cheap
But still you climb, with hope and grace
A team that shines in every race

Through highs and lows, through sweat and tears
You carry on, with steadfast cheers
For you believe in what you do
And know someday your dream comes true

For startups are a special breed
A force like none that I have seen
They take on challenges so great
And never rest until it's late

With eyes fixed firm on the prize
They boldly dare to think and try
And through their pioneering ways
They shape the world in countless ways

So to you, dear team, I offer this
A tribute to your strength and bliss
For though the road ahead is long
You'll reach the top with grace and song

And when you do, the world will know
That startups thrive where others go
And that with courage and with might
You built a brand that shines so bright

So carry on, dear team, and know
That you have what it takes to grow
And in your hearts and minds, you'll see
The greatness that will always be.
