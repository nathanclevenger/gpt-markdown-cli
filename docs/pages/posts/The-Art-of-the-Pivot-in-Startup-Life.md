# The Art of the Pivot in Startup Life

In startup life, we often find  
That things don’t always go to plan  
Although we’ve given it our all  
There’s simply no guarantee that our startup stands  

As entrepreneurs, we’re brave and bold  
We take risks in everything we do  
But sometimes we must accept the truth  
That our plan may need a redo  

The pivot, it’s a powerful thing  
It’s what makes startups flourish and grow  
It’s when we change our strategy  
That we start to see the real glow  

It’s not an easy road to take  
To admit that we have gone astray  
But the art of the pivot is essential  
It’s how our startups pave the way  

We must be flexible and adaptable  
Willing to take the risk and explore  
To try something new, out of the box  
And see what opportunities are in store  

For every pivot is a chance  
To reassess our goals and our path  
To discover what’s truly important  
And what we need to do make the business last  

It’s about looking at the data  
And listening to what the market says  
To realize what the customers want  
And adapt quickly to build our success  

When we pivot, we must do so with a plan  
To make sure it’s not just a shot in the dark  
For we need to keep our vision in sight  
While also making a meaningful mark  

The pivot, it’s not just a one-time thing  
It’s a constant part of startup life  
For we must always be looking ahead  
And adjusting to avoid unnecessary strife  

It’s the art of the pivot that sets us apart  
From those who settle for mediocrity  
For in startups, it’s those who adapt and change  
Who will truly achieve sustainability  

So to all the startup founders out there  
Keep in mind the art of the pivot  
For it’s the key to success in startup life  
And the path to building a business that’s truly exquisite.
