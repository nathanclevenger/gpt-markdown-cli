# Lessons Learned from Startup Life

We dream of unicorns, 
valleys filled with gold. 
In hopes of scaling up, 
our passions we unfold. 

We dive into the deep end, 
with no guide in sight. 
Endless hours we spend, 
to bring our vision to light. 

We hope it'll be easy, 
that growth will come fast. 
But startup life is queasy, 
a journey that will last. 

Lessons learned are plenty, 
some harder than the rest. 
We've gathered wisdom aplenty, 
to pass on to the rest. 

First, we must embrace failure, 
it's part of the game. 
It will become our fuel, 
to sustain us through the flame. 

Second, we need a team, 
to help bring our vision alive. 
With hardworking members in a scheme, 
the journey is more than a five. 

Third, we must listen closely, 
to the customers we serve. 
Our goal is to solve problems mostly, 
with feedback we'll make the curve. 

Fourth, we must pivot gracefully, 
without losing our direction. 
Our plan must be done thoughtfully, 
what worked in the past, needs inspection. 

Fifth, we must make hard choices, 
with limited resources at hand. 
Our goal is to quiet the noises, 
to make sure the business will stand. 

Sixth, we must celebrate wins, 
big or small, they are all important. 
For, in the life of a startup, 
success is not a common event. 

Seventh, we must keep the passion, 
that drove us here in the first place. 
For ‘Startup life’ is out of fashion, 
but it’s only with passion we’ll win the race. 

Eighth, we must never lose sight, 
of why we started the venture. 
Our goal must carry the light, 
with a mission that is pure and sure. 

Ninth, we must take breaks, 
to breathe, recharge and renew. 
To avoid mistakes and heartaches, 
our well-being is important—it’s true. 

Tenth, we must have faith, 
that our efforts will lead the way. 
Though the road ahead may be a wraith, 
trust your vision, it will never stray. 

Startup life is a journey, 
unique in every way. 
Lessons learned is our tourney, 
with nothing left to say. 

So, enjoy the journey, 
with a heart full of a zeal. 
Lessons learned are plenty, 
for every startup to seal.
