# The Fierce Determination of Startup Life

Startup life, a world of dreams  
A world where passion reigns supreme  
Where every day, ideas are born  
And every night, they’re built upon

In this world, there is no rest  
No time for sleep, no time to rest  
There is no such thing as a day off  
For those who want to make it, but often scoff

The challenges here are immense  
The competition never seems to be less  
But for the ones who made the choice  
The ones who started with a distinct voice

It's not just about the money  
It’s about the dream that's sunny  
The one that burns deep inside  
In every entrepreneur's mind

From the smallest product to the biggest  
The startup world defies logistics  
It's about taking risks and hoping for the best  
It’s about facing failures and putting them to rest

Every day's spent building something new  
A prototype or maybe just something blue  
Every day's spent finding the next way  
To make a difference, to bring change

There are wins, there are losses  
Days when progress seems to stall  
But to those who persevere  
The dream of success is always near

Through each hurdle, they push and prod  
Determined to make it, nothing can be flawed  
They live by the motto, “never quit”  
For in this startup life, only the determined survive

The entrepreneurial journey is never easy  
It's full of highs and, of course, full of lows  
But every step taken, every challenge surmounted  
Become the building blocks of a story that's paramount

For the ones who choose this path  
The fierce determination becomes a craft  
A skill that's necessary to survive  
In this world of startups where dreams come alive

So to all the dreamers out there  
The ones who dare to start and care  
Remember that the journey will be tough  
But the reward at the end is more than enough

For in the end, when all is said and done  
The startup life that you began, would have won  
And the legacy that you've left behind  
Will inspire more dreamers, to make the startup life their find.
