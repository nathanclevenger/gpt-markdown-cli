# Starting Up: A Poem for Entrepreneurs

A whisper of an idea,
A flicker of a spark,
A deep-seated passion 
That ignites from the dark.

A vision of a future,
A longing for a change,
A relentless drive
That can't be restrained.

A leap of faith taken,
A risk without a net,
A belief in oneself
That they'll overcome and get.

A journey without a map,
A path that's uncharted,
A will to discover
The unknown that's warranted.

An army of one,
A teammate or two,
A bond that's unbreakable,
That sees the vision through.

A challenge at every turn,
A learning every day,
A desire to improve
And make a better way.

A community that supports,
A network that grows,
A bond that strengthens
As success overflows.

A dream realized,
A purposeful life,
A legacy created 
That outshines the strife.

Starting up is an adventure,
An entrepreneurial ride,
A rollercoaster with ups and downs,
And the occasional slide.

But with passion, perseverance,
And a will to succeed,
Entrepreneurs can conquer,
As they plant their hopeful seed.

So to all the dreamers out there,
Who yearn to make a mark,
Remember that starting up,
Is the ultimate spark.
