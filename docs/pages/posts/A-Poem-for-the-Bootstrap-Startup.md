# A Poem for the Bootstrap Startup

Oh, Bootstrap Startups, hear my song,
It won't be long, but hear me strong,
With every step you take, you grow so strong,
And with each stride, you'll find where you belong.

The road ahead may seem so long,
Days and nights blur, hours become gone,
But every small step, will help you along,
And bring you closer to your startup's song.

From late nights and endless coding,
To days spent networking and promoting,
Each day brings new challenges, new teachings,
A never-ending journey, always forthcoming.

For those who dare to venture forth,
To brave the storms and take the course,
A promising chance awaits, and so much more,
As long as you keep pushing forward.

At times, it may feel difficult, even rough,
Like you're drowning, and have had enough,
But keep in mind, the progress you've made,
The ideas and solutions that you've relayed.

Each time you fail, it's not the end,
Just another opportunity to mend,
To adjust, rethink, and comprehensively blend,
So that your startup can mend.

Your passion and drive must stay on fire,
It's what sets your soul apart from others' desire,
Don't let the hurdles break you or make you tire,
They're just teachings that will help you aspire.

Your vision and end-goal clear in sight,
May take many twists and turns, and might,
But every step you take, will lift you to new heights,
And help you achieve what was once a dream, in plain sight.

Bootstrap Startups, hold your head up high,
Believe in what you do, and pursue to try,
Take chance after chance, and on a limb, fly,
Onwards and upwards, reach for the sky.

The struggle is real, the journey is long,
But when you reach the finish, the reward is strong,
Bootstrap Startups, hear my song,
Let your passion and drive pave your way along.
