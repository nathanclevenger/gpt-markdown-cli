# The Highs and Lows of Startup Life

A startup makes a dream come true  
But it also brings forth a different view  
A roller-coaster ride, an uncertain game  
Where day and night often feel the same  

The highs can be exhilarating and intense  
As you see your vision come to life and make sense  
The adrenaline rush of a successful pitch  
Brings a feeling that can be hard to switch  

But the lows are equally as real and tough  
As everything you've built feels like it's not enough  
When the funding falls through, or sales drop low  
It's easy to feel like you've got nowhere to go  

The journey of a startup is a risk we take  
We take each chance, and each mistake  
We learn to adapt, we learn to pivot  
We jump higher, as we learn to live it  

The vision, hope, and passion drive us on  
But resilience, grit, and perseverance will make us strong  
The never-ending war between success and failure  
Reminds us, every day, that life is an adventure  

The start is an exciting journey, but it's also hard  
The setbacks and challenges we face can leave us scarred  
But it's in the lows where we find our strength  
And in the highs where we celebrate, at length  

For every moment of doubt and fear  
There's a breakthrough that brings cheer  
That one deal, that one win  
That one pivot that gets you back in  

It's a humbling journey, this startup life  
But it's also full of meaning, hope, and strife  
A chance to make a difference, and chase a dream  
A chance to grow, to learn, and to redeem  

So remember, my friend, as you go through each day  
That the highs and the lows are just a part of the way  
Keep your eyes on the vision, and your feet on the ground  
And let the startup experience, shape and astound.
