# Startup Success: A Journey Through Failure

Startups are a world all their own  
With tales of triumph and moments unknown  
A path uncharted, with destiny unclear  
A journey of failures, but success is near  

The road to success is often paved with fear  
Doubt creeps in, yet you have to persevere  
Success is a marathon, not a mere sprint  
You have to keep going, with every ounce of your strength  

Failure is a teacher, it's a chance to learn  
It teaches you to pivot or change your turn  
Sometimes it takes many tries to get it right  
But your tenacity will enable you to take flight  

Starting up a business is not for the faint  
You start with an idea, but execution's the main  
It takes grit and hard work, and a lot of patience  
But when success happens, it's worth all the persistence  

Failure and success go hand in hand  
For every door that closes, another will stand  
Keep pushing forward, and fighting for what you believe  
And you'll be surprised at what you can achieve  

Startups are a journey, with plenty of twists  
Failures will happen, but don't let them persist  
Embrace the struggles and grow with each test  
For your success story will indeed be the best  

So here's to the startups, the founders and the crew  
May you keep moving forward, and stay focused on your view  
The journey is long, but the rewards are great  
And remember that every failure is just a stepping stone to your fate.
