# The Hubris of Startup Life

From garages to boardrooms,  
The startup life takes flight.  
Founders, dreamers, risk-takers,  
All believing they're right.  

They pitch their grand ideas,  
Seeking funding in the fray.  
Sweating through the PowerPoints,  
Hoping it all pays.  

And when the investors come,  
Their hubris grows so tall.  
They think they've cracked the market,  
And that they'll win it all.  

But hubris blinds them to the signs,  
That things may not go well.  
They ignore the experts' doubts,  
And spin a web to sell.  

The team is overworked and stressed,  
But the founders push ahead.  
They say they'll sleep when they're dead,  
And work until they've bled.  

The product launch is imminent,  
The hype is off the charts.  
But when reality sets in,  
The cracks begin to start.  

The bugs and flaws are plentiful,  
The users are not appeased.  
The founders start to panic:  
They're not as great as they believed.  

Their hubris starts to crumble,  
As the clock ticks ever close.  
They realize they may have failed,  
And death may be the close.  

The startup life is not for all,  
Though many will still try.  
But hubris is the enemy,  
And will surely make them die.  

So heed the lessons of the past,  
And trust the experts well.  
Work hard and with resilience,  
But know when to let things fail.  

For startups have their place,  
But hubris is their bane.  
May you launch with humility,  
And find success without shame.
