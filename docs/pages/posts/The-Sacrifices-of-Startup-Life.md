# The Sacrifices of Startup Life

Oh the life of a startup,
An adventure we've all dreamed,
A chance to make a big impact,
So it seems.

We see the success stories,
The unicorns shining bright,
But what we don't see,
Are the sacrifices, day and night.

Oh the sleepless nights,
The endless workdays,
The stress and the pressure,
That we can't seem to shake.

Time with loved ones,
An elusive treasure indeed,
As the startup demands our attention,
And time is all we need.

Financial struggles,
Uncertainty always near,
As we try to make our vision,
Our reality appear.

Friends and hobbies,
Sacrificed out of need,
For the startup always beckons,
And the pressures never ease.

Health and wellness,
A challenge we must face,
As stress takes its toll,
On our minds and our race.

We push through the struggles,
With determination and grit,
For the startup is our dream,
And we will not quit.

We celebrate the small wins,
On this journey we're on,
For the road is long and bumpy,
And the startup life is never done.

So let us remember the sacrifices,
That we make every day,
For the startup life is not easy,
But we wouldn't have it any other way.
