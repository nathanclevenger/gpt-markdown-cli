# The Perseverance of Startup Life

In the world of startups,  
The road is never smooth,  
It's a journey full of hurdles,  
And never-ending grooves.  

It starts with an idea,  
A spark in someone's mind,  
And soon it becomes a dream,  
With passion hard to find.  

It takes a lot of courage,  
To chase what isn't seen,  
With the risk and uncertainty,  
It's a game that's tough and mean.  

The path is full of obstacles,  
And often, it's long and wide,  
But with perseverance as our guide,  
We navigate through the tide.  

The first step is the toughest,  
As we step into the unknown,  
But we take it with conviction,  
To build something of our own.  

We face failure at every step,  
But we rise every time we fall,  
We take the lessons on our stride,  
And we never lose sight of our goal.  

The journey is full of sacrifices,  
Of time, money, and comfort too,  
But we take it all in our stride,  
For we know, it will all be worth it soon.  

The startup life is not just about work,  
It's also about a community we build,  
With team members, advisors, and mentors,  
And like-minded people sharing the same guild.  

We celebrate the small wins,  
And we learn from the mistakes,  
We pick ourselves up every time,  
And we never rest on our breaks.  

The passion keeps us going,  
And the drive never fades away,  
For we know that in the end,  
The perseverance is the only way.  

So here's to the founders,  
Who chase their dreams every day,  
Your hard work and perseverance,  
Is what takes the startups a long way.  

In the end, the startup journey,  
Is not just about the destination,  
It's about the courage, passion, and perseverance,  
To chase what seemed like an imagination.  

Embrace the challenges,  
And keep the fire burning bright,  
For the perseverance of startup life,  
Will be worth the wait and the fight.
