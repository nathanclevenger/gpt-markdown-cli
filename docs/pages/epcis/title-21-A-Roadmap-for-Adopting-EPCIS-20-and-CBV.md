## 1. Introduction

With supply chain management becoming increasingly complex, there is a growing need for standardized and efficient systems for managing data exchange. The Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) provide a collaborative framework for capturing and sharing information in supply chains.

Globally, industries have adopted EPCIS 2.0 and CBV to streamline their operations and gain greater visibility into their logistics processes. This blog post will explore the significance, benefits, and implementation of the EPCIS 2.0 and CBV standards, offering a comprehensive roadmap for those looking to adopt these systems.

## 2. Understanding EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

-->

### 2.1 What is EPCIS 2.0?

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 is a global standard that enables trading partners to store and exchange information about the movement and status of objects within supply chains. EPCIS 2.0 is event-based, allowing businesses to capture specific product-related actions (such as commissioning, shipping, and receiving) and access a real-time record of these events.

### 2.2 What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is designed to complement EPCIS by providing a common vocabulary and data format to describe supply chain events. It establishes a standardized framework for capturing information such as the type, location, and time of each event, enabling seamless communication between partners and systems.
