## Introduction

In today's competitive business environment, managing supply chain processes efficiently have become a crucial aspect to maintain competitiveness. Supply chain visibility, real-time data insights, and seamless integration of technologies are indispensable for effective supply chain management. Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are two essential tools facilitating data exchange and collaboration within the supply chain. This blog post will discuss the importance of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, how to integrate IoT and RFID devices effectively, data management and insights through APIs, and other critical aspects to maximize the potential of these technologies in your supply chain.

## What is EPCIS 2.0 and CBV?

EPCIS is a standardized framework for the exchange of supply chain event data associated with serialized products. It enables businesses to share their data on product status, history, and location with other trading partners securely.

The EPCIS 2.0 is an updated version that introduces new features and enhancements, which makes it even more effective for managing supply chain data. The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is the set of standardized terms used when creating EPCIS event records, ensuring consistent communication between trading partners.
