## Introduction

The supply chain industry has always faced a never-ending challenge in trying to streamline and improve data exchange between businesses. As technology continues to advance, there's an ever-growing need for seamless connections, data transparency, and secure collaboration. One solution that promises to meet these needs is the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV).

The CBV, along with the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0, aims to provide a more efficient and straightforward way for companies to share and track essential product data across the entire supply chain. In this blog post, we will explore what CBV is, the evolution into EPCIS 2.0, and how it can enhance essential facets of a connected supply chain, including APIs, EDI, IoT, printing, scanning, and the integration of RFID.

## Understanding CBV

The CBV is a standardized set of definitions designed to ensure consistent communication between trading partners. It covers all aspects of the supply chain, from raw materials and manufacturing to distribution, logistics, and retail. This standard defines a common vocabulary for exchanging business data (such as product information, shipment data, and event data) and is the foundation for exchanging data using the EPCIS standard.

CBV is a crucial part of implementing EPCIS, as it provides clear definitions and guidelines for data sharing, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and errors. It helps organizations better understand their supply chain processes and creates a solid foundation for enhanced visibility, efficiency, and collaboration.

## The Evolution of CBV: EPCIS 2.0

The development of EPCIS 2.0 has heralded a new era for data exchange and collaboration in the supply chain. This latest version of EPCIS includes significant improvements to CBV, enabling businesses to exchange data more efficiently and consistently.

EPCIS 2.0 brings several new features and enhancements to the standard, such as:

- **Richer Data:** The updated standard allows for the exchange of more comprehensive information about products, assets, and events, providing a more detailed view of the supply chain.

- **Improved Serialization:** EPCIS 2.0 supports serialization at a more granular level, meaning companies can track and manage individual items or groups of items more effectively.

- **Enhanced Interoperability:** The updated standard provides clearer guidelines for data sharing, making it easier for organizations to collaborate and exchange data with their partners.

- **Better Scalability:** EPCIS 2.0 is designed to meet the growing demands of the supply chain industry, ensuring that businesses can scale their data exchange and collaboration efforts as needed.

All these enhancements lead to a more seamless and efficient approach to data exchange, enabling businesses to improve their supply chain visibility and collaboration.

## APIs and EDI: A Valuable Partnership

The combination of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards creates a powerful synergy, enabling businesses to share and integrate data across their supply chain more seamlessly. CBV and EPCIS 2.0 play a central role in this partnership, as they provide the uniform language needed for exchanging data effortlessly.

When used in conjunction with APIs, CBV and EPCIS 2.0 enable real-time communication between trading partners, ensuring that crucial information is always up-to-date and improving overall visibility into supply chain processes. On the other hand, EDI translates essential data into a structured, standardized format, making it easier for companies to exchange information with their partners.

By leveraging APIs, CBV, and EPCIS 2.0, companies can create a more connected and collaborative supply chain, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of errors as data is exchanged between partners.

## IoT and RFID: Connecting Physical Assets in a Digital World

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology are transforming how businesses track, manage and exchange data about their products and assets. CBV and EPCIS 2.0 further enhance this connection, providing a consistent language for conveying information about the physical objects through digital means.

RFID technology allows companies to track and manage their assets in real-time, offering invaluable insight into their supply chain operations. Along with IoT devices, this technology can provide a better understanding of product movements, location, and conditions, enabling businesses to make more informed decisions.

By integrating CBV and EPCIS 2.0, companies can streamline the process of data exchange between their IoT devices, RFID systems, and supply chain partners. This level of interoperability is essential for achieving a more practical, efficient, and collaborative approach to supply chain management.

## Printing and Scanning: Crucial Components of a Connected Supply Chain

The accurate printing and scanning of product information (such as barcode or RFID labels) is a critical element of any modern supply chain. These technologies rely on accurate and timely data to function effectively, making CBV and EPCIS 2.0 especially relevant in their use.

CBV and EPCIS 2.0 provide standardized guidelines for exchanging data between printing and scanning equipment, ensuring that the information provided is consistent and reliable. By integrating these standards within their printing and scanning processes, businesses can minimize the risk of errors and improve overall efficiency.

In addition, leveraging CBV and EPCIS 2.0 enables organizations to gain better visibility into their supply chains, helping them better manage their inventory and assets.
