## 2. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

Electronic Data Interchange is the digital exchange of business documents between companies. It has allowed businesses to communicate faster and more efficiently than ever before. It streamlines business processes by replacing paperwork and automating transactions, leading to quicker order processing, reduced manual errors, and improved overall efficiency.

EDI has significantly impacted various industries, especially those involved in supply chain management, retail, healthcare, and financial services. Although incredibly useful in its time, the rise of the Internet and new communication technologies spurred the development of more advanced tools.

## 3. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

Application Programming Interfaces, commonly referred to as APIs, serve as a communication method between different software applications. APIs enable software programs to interact with one another, fetch data, and perform various tasks without any user intervention.

APIs work seamlessly behind the scenes, providing developers with the tools they need to create innovative and interconnected applications. They have become a vital component in modern software development and are key drivers in the growth and expansion of the Internet.

## 4. Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things, or IoT, describes the vast network of interconnected devices (including smartphones, vehicles, and home appliances) that communicate with each other through the Internet. IoT devices collect data, analyze it, and use the insights gained to improve performance, efficiency, and convenience.

IoT is revolutionizing industries and changing the way we live and work. It has given rise to smart homes, wearable devices, and industrial automation, making our lives more comfortable and efficient while keeping us more informed than ever before. The potential of IoT is vast, and its full impact on business and day-to-day life is still unfolding.

## 5. RFID and EPCIS 2.0

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track objects, usually through an RFID tag. RFID technology is commonly used for inventory management, asset tracking, and contactless payments. It enables real-time inventory visibility and streamlines supply chain management, providing an increased level of efficiency and accuracy.

RFID technology works in conjunction with the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS), a global standard for sharing data on items moving through the supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 introduces enhancements to the standard, including more extensive support for IoT devices and sensor data, making it increasingly relevant in today's interconnected world.

## 6. Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is the standard language of EPCIS, designed to ensure consistent communication between different systems. It helps businesses share information effectively by defining standard terms, processes, and data formats. By adopting CBV, businesses enable seamless information flow and enhanced collaboration.

CBV standardizes various aspects of data exchange, including:

- Object identification
- Event types
- Location identifiers
- Sensor readings
