Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a global GS1 Standard that enables trading partners to share information about the physical movement and status of products as they travel throughout the supply chain. The standard has been widely adopted across various industries to improve supply chain visibility, traceability, and collaboration. In this guide, we will dive into the recent updates of EPCIS 2.0, and its companion standard Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) 2.0.

## 1. EPCIS 1.2 to 2.0: A Brief History

EPCIS 1.0 was first published in 2007, with subsequent updates to version 1.1 and 1.2 throughout the following years. Over a decade later, the release of EPCIS 2.0 brings significant updates and improvements to cater to modern supply chains.

## 2. Key Changes in EPCIS 2.0

The fundamental structure of EPCIS remains unchanged, retaining the four primary event types: Object, Aggregation, Transaction, and Transformation events. However, EPCIS 2.0 brings several new features and updates:

### 2.1 Improved Data Model and Syntax

EPCIS 2.0 introduces a single XML or JSON format for all EPCIS events, making it easier for implementers to support both formats. This helps streamline event processing, reduce implementation errors, and simplify data exchange within the supply chain.

### 2.2 Location and Party Master Data

Location and Party Master Data are essential components of EPCIS events. In EPCIS 2.0, they are now represented as individual classes, making it easier to manage and associate with EPCIS events. Additionally, EPCIS 2.0 defines vocabularies for Location and Party Master Data.

### 2.3 Data Privacy and Security

Data privacy and security have become increasingly important in recent years. EPCIS 2.0 includes updates around data protection and security, ensuring that sensitive information can be shared without compromising business confidentiality.

## 3. Enhancements in CBV 2.0

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) defines the data values that populate EPCIS events from both business and technical perspectives. CBV 2.0 builds upon the previous version and includes the following enhancements:

### 3.1 New Disposition Vocabulary

CBV 2.0 introduces a new Disposition vocabulary that allows organizations to define the state of an object within the supply chain, providing additional information on each object such as quality or condition.

### 3.2 Additional Event and Error Declarations

CBV 2.0 extends the list of event and error declarations to cover a wider range of scenarios, improving the precision and granularity of traceability data.

## 4. IoT, Printing, Scanning, and RFID

EPCIS 2.0 enables seamless integration with IoT, Printing, Scanning, and RFID technologies to provide real-time visibility into the location, condition, and status of products. This helps improve efficiency and accuracy while reducing the reliance on manual data entry.

## 5. APIs and EDI in EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 supports Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), making it easier to exchange EPCIS data between systems in a standardized manner. This enhances interoperability across different sectors and industries, fostering collaboration and coordination among trading partners.

## 6. How to Adopt EPCIS 2.0 and CBV 2.0

Organizations looking to adopt EPCIS 2.0 and CBV 2.0 should begin by assessing their current capabilities and understanding the value derived from sharing traceability data. They can then develop strategies to implement EPCIS and CBV, taking into account the necessary investments in technology, training, and process changes. GS1 offers comprehensive resources and support services to aid organizations with their EPCIS adoption journey.
