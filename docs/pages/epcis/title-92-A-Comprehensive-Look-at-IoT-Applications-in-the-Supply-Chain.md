## 1. Introduction

In today's globalized economy, supply chain management has become an integral aspect for businesses to ensure seamless operations and meet the demands of their customers. One technology that has proven to be a game-changer for the supply chain industry is the Internet of Things (IoT). By leveraging IoT's interconnected ecosystem, organizations in the supply chain can gain real-time insights, improve overall efficiency, and reduce operating costs.

This blog post explores IoT applications in the supply chain, covering key technologies such as APIs, EDI, IoT, Printing, Scanning, and RFID. Additionally, we will discuss the significance of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in IoT-driven supply chain solutions. Lastly, we will delve into the benefits and challenges associated with implementing IoT in the supply chain industry.

## 2. IoT Technologies: APIs, EDI, IoT, Printing, Scanning, & RFID

IoT-driven supply chain management strategies involve using a combination of several technologies, including:

- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: APIs facilitate the seamless exchange of information between IoT devices, cloud platforms, and applications. They act as a bridge that connects various components of an IoT ecosystem.

- **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**: Using a standardized communication protocol, EDI technology enables the exchange of business documents, such as purchase orders and invoices, between organizations in an automated, electronic format.

- **IoT Devices**: IoT devices, such as sensors and GPS trackers, collect and transmit real-time data from physical objects in the supply chain. This data is used to gain insights and make informed decisions.

- **Printing and Scanning**: IoT-enabled printers and scanners facilitate automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) by generating or reading barcodes, RFID tags, and other labels.

- **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**: RFID technology uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track objects throughout the supply chain automatically. RFID tags store and transmit data to IoT devices and systems, providing real-time visibility of an item's location.

## 3. EPCIS 2.0 and CBV - Foundation for IoT in the Supply Chain

In the realm of IoT-driven supply chain solutions, the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standards serve as key building blocks. These standards, developed by GS1, pave the way for interoperability and seamless communication between supply chain participants.

**EPCIS 2.0** offers a standardized framework for capturing event data throughout the supply chain. By incorporating EPCIS into IoT supply chain solutions, businesses can share real-time information about an object's location, condition, and status with trading partners.

**CBV** complements the EPCIS 2.0 standard by defining the terminology used in EPCIS event data, ensuring that supply chain participants have a common language to communicate event information.

Together, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV create a solid foundation for IoT-driven supply chain management.
