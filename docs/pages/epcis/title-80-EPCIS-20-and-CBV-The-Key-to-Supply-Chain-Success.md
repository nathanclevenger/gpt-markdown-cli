## Introduction

In today's highly competitive and interconnected business landscape, companies need full visibility and traceability throughout the entire supply chain. With the growth of globalization and e-commerce, supply chains have significantly increased in complexity, demanding real-time information exchange and seamless integration across multiple stakeholders. This is where EPCIS 2.0 and CBV come in and pave the way for effective supply chain management.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a set of global standards developed by GS1, an international nonprofit organization responsible for designing and implementing supply chain standards, barcodes, and electronic communication protocols worldwide.

EPCIS 2.0 represents the latest version of the EPCIS standard, which allows trading partners to capture and share information regarding specific events occurring in the supply chain, such as product movements, stock, and state changes. This standardized framework ensures that all parties involved in a supply chain can effectively communicate with each other, using a common language.

## What is CBV?

CBV (Core Business Vocabulary) is a companion standard to EPCIS, which defines standard vocabulary for business events related to supply chain processes. It serves as a crucial reference to facilitate interoperability, making it easier for different software applications and platforms to communicate supply chain events in a consistent manner.
