## 1. Introduction

The world has become increasingly connected through the use of technology, enabling rapid exchange of data between various parties. This exchange of data is vital for businesses, especially those in industries such as supply chain and logistics, eCommerce, healthcare, and beyond. 

With the implementation of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), organizations can efficiently share and track data, enabling greater visibility within these industries. This article aims to explore the latest developments in EPCIS 2.0 and CBV 2.0, and how they aid in streamlining data exchange.

## 2. EPCIS and CBV: A Quick Overview

**EPCIS** is a standard developed by GS1 that allows organizations to share information about the physical movement and status of products as they travel through the supply chain. It serves as a means of capturing and sharing event data in a standardized manner, which can then be used for improved supply chain visibility, traceability, and analytics.

**CBV**, on the other hand, is a complementary standard that defines a common language to describe business processes, locations, and industry-specific vocabulary elements. It enables parties to understand the context of the EPCIS event data and ensures interoperability between different systems.

Together, EPCIS and CBV form a powerful combination for tracking and sharing data within the supply chain, enabling organizations to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## 3. What's New in EPCIS 2.0 and CBV 2.0

The latest versions of EPCIS (2.0) and CBV (2.0) have been released to improve efficiency, interoperability, and flexibility. These updates enable businesses to optimize their data exchange processes, and stay ahead in the competitive landscape. The primary focus of these new versions is to expand EPCIS's capabilities, introduce new vocabularies, and provide better support for IoT devices.

## 4. Improving Data Exchange with EPCIS 2.0

EPCIS 2.0 introduces several significant improvements, which are discussed below.

<a name="json-and-json-ld"></a>
### 4.1 Increased Flexibility with JSON and JSON-LD

In addition to the existing XML format, EPCIS 2.0 also supports JSON and JSON-LD formats. JSON's easy-to-read and lightweight structure provides greater flexibility, simplifying implementation and improving data exchange between systems. This is especially beneficial when integrating with various web and mobile applications, as JSON is widely supported across platforms.

### 4.2 Extensible Event Types

EPCIS 2.0 introduces extensible event types, allowing organizations to customize event types according to their specific needs. This feature enables businesses to define additional event types beyond the standard EPCIS events, ensuring that they can capture and represent data more accurately.

### 4.3 Decoupling Master Data

In EPCIS 2.0, master data can be decoupled from event data to simplify implementation and reduce potential redundancies. This enables businesses to manage their master data effectively while ensuring that event data is still available when needed.

## 5. Enhanced Business Context with CBV 2.0

Alongside EPCIS 2.0, the new version of CBV introduces several enhancements and new vocabulary elements.

<a name="new-vocabulary-elements"></a>
### 5.1 New Vocabulary Elements

CBV 2.0 introduces new business vocabulary elements such as "Business Process Steps" and "Transformation Events" to better support various industry-specific use cases. These new elements enable richer and more accurate data representation, improving communication between different systems.

<a name="unambiguous-identifiers"></a>
### 5.2 Unambiguous Identifiers

CBV 2.0 enhances data exchange by ensuring that identifiers are unambiguous and globally unique. This allows various systems to accurately identify and interpret the data being shared, reducing the possibility of errors and misunderstandings.
