## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The rapid advancement of technology has led to the development of efficient systems to manage the flow of information across various industries. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the core principles and benefits of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), and how they play a vital role in enabling seamless data exchange and enhanced visibility across businesses.

## 2. What is EPCIS 2.0? <a name="what_is_epcis_20"></a>

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a GS1 Standard designed to facilitate access to event-related data associated with products, supply chain partners, and business processes. Originally introduced in 2007, EPCIS enables seamless sharing and retrieval of product lifecycle events allowing visibility into the "who, what, when, where, why & how" of a product journey, thereby ensuring better supply chain traceability, accuracy, and management.

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the standard, which was released in April 2021. It comes with major upgrades that cater to new data sharing requirements and incorporate feedback from users around the world.

## 3. Core Principles of EPCIS 2.0 <a name="core_principles_of_epcis_20"></a>

### 3.1 Visibility Data <a name="visibility_data"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 aims to provide improved visibility into the various stages of a product's lifecycle. It achieves this by capturing, processing, and sharing event data, which can be classified as:

- Object and action (what)
- Location (where)
- Timestamp (when)
- Business context (why)
- Actor (who)

Using a standardized format, EPCIS 2.0 captures and exchanges information about events across different applications and organizations, leveraging various technologies such as APIs, EDI, IoT, RFID, Printing, and Scanning.

### 3.2 Capture and Query Interfaces <a name="capture_and_query_interfaces"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 comprises two major interfaces: Capture and Query. The Capture Interface is responsible for the collection of EPCIS events and Master Data from various sources like sensors, devices, or applications. The collected data, formatted in EPCIS standard, is then stored in an EPCIS Repository.

The Query Interface plays a crucial role in sharing the collected event data with interested parties, such as supply chain partners, internal departments, or external applications. Authorized users can send query requests and receive the relevant event data in a standardized format in response.

### 3.3 Interoperability <a name="interoperability"></a>

One of the primary objectives of EPCIS 2.0 is to ensure interoperability between different systems, applications, and organizations. It achieves this by providing a standardized vocabulary, format, and interface for exchanging event data.

By adhering to the EPCIS 2.0 standard, companies can benefit from seamless data exchange and collaboration across various partners, vendors, and stakeholders in the entire supply chain.

## 4. What is CBV? <a name="what_is_cbv"></a>

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a companion standard to EPCIS. It provides a standard set of vocabularies, identifiers, and data attributes to be used while implementing EPCIS in various business operations. CBV ensures consistency in data modeling, interpretation, and exchange across multiple domains.

By leveraging CBV, EPCIS 2.0 facilitates a common understanding of event data, ensuring the proper organization and interpretation of the captured information.

## 5. The Benefits of Using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV <a name="the_benefits_of_using_epcis_20_and_cbv"></a>

The combined use of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV offers several advantages to businesses. Some of the key benefits include:

- Enhanced supply chain visibility and traceability.
- Improved inventory management and optimization.
- Increased operational efficiency and accuracy.
- Seamless data exchange and collaboration among supply chain partners.
- Reduction in administrative work, manual efforts, and errors.
- Informed decision-making and better risk management.
- Facilitation of compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Strengthened consumer trust and engagement.

## 6. Applications and Use Cases <a name="applications_and_use_cases"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be utilized in a wide range of industries and applications. Here are some notable use cases:

### 6.1 Inventory Management <a name="inventory_management"></a>

By providing real-time product information, EPCIS 2.0 enables companies to optimize their inventory levels, reducing stock-outs and overstocks. Moreover, it helps businesses identify discrepancies, manage recalls, and ensure product availability for consumers.

### 6.2 Supply Chain Visibility <a name="supply_chain_visibility"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 facilitates end-to-end supply chain visibility by capturing and sharing event data among all stakeholders in the supply chain, from manufacturers to retailers. Companies can monitor the movement of goods, identify bottlenecks, and streamline processes with improved access to relevant information.

### 6.3 Food Safety and Traceability <a name="food_safety_and_traceability"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can be utilized to ensure food safety and traceability by capturing and transmitting information about the provenance, handling, and transportation of food products. This can help in quickly identifying and addressing issues related to product quality, safety, and potential contamination.

### 6.4 Consumer Engagement <a name="consumer_engagement"></a>

A wide range of consumer-facing applications can be developed using EPCIS 2.0 and CBV. These applications allow consumers to access detailed product information, such as origin, authenticity, and environmental impact data. This builds trust, empowers consumers to make informed choices, and ultimately drives brand loyalty.

## 7. Best Practices and Implementation <a name="best_practices_and_implementation"></a>

To harness the full potential of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, organizations should:

- Collaborate with internal teams, supply chain partners, and GS1 to establish a shared understanding of requirements and goals.
- Conduct training and workshops to familiarize employees with EPCIS 2.0 and CBV concepts, processes, and technologies.
- Define appropriate Master Data, event types, and related attributes for each use case.
- Implement a data governance policy and ensure data quality, accuracy, and security.
- Leverage the expertise of third-party providers and consultants to ensure successful implementation and integration of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV.

## 8. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The adoption of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV can bring unprecedented benefits to businesses in terms of improved visibility, streamlined processes, and enhanced collaboration. As more and more companies embrace these standards, enterprises will be well-positioned to realize a more transparent, efficient, and trustworthy supply chain.
