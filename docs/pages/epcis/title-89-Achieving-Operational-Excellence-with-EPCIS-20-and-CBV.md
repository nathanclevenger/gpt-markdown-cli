## 2. What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, a global framework for sharing critical supply chain information. The primary goal of EPCIS is to offer a standard means of capturing, processing, and exchanging information about physical and digital objects throughout the supply chain. This updated version includes enhanced features and improvements to facilitate data exchange, support IoT devices, and allow seamless integration with other systems.
