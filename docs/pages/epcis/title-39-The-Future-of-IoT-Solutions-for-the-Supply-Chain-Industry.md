## 2. Current State of IoT

IoT technologies are already making a substantial impact on the supply chain industry by providing real-time visibility, increased efficiency, and cost reductions. Applications such as smart warehouses, connected logistics, and intelligent transportation are just a few examples showcasing the collaboration between IoT devices and supply chain operations. Today, businesses are leveraging IoT devices, RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags, GPS tracking, and sensor technology to optimize their operations, reduce risks, and deliver better customer experiences.

## 3. EPCIS 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) Standards

Maintaining a standardized approach to communication is essential for ensuring seamless integration of IoT within the supply chain. One such significant standardization effort is the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) framework. EPCIS is a GS1 standard that enables businesses to exchange information related to the movement and status of goods in the supply chain.

EPCIS 2.0, the latest iteration of this standard, brings significant improvements, such as:
- Enhanced data model
- Inclusion of IoT sensor data
- Additional business context
- Support for applying the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) to IoT events

The CBV complements EPCIS by providing standardized terminology, allowing businesses to communicate consistently and accurately about various elements in supply chain events, such as:
- Business steps
- Disposition of items
- Transportation modes

By adopting EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, the supply chain industry can enhance interoperability, benefiting all stakeholders across the chain.
