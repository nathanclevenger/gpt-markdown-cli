## Introduction

The world of supply chain management, procurement, and manufacturing is on a continuous quest to achieve higher levels of efficiency, transparency, and connectivity. Businesses strive to stay ahead of the competition and leverage technologies that enhance their growth. Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) have emerged as potent tools that empower businesses to manage more complex chains.

In this comprehensive blog post, we will explore the importance of EPCIS 2.0 and CBV for business growth by examining their features, benefits, and implementation strategies. This valuable information will help businesses understand how they can harness EPCIS 2.0 and CBV, along with other key technologies such as APIs, EDI, Internet of Things (IoT), Printing, Scanning, and RFID, which will eventually result in improved processes, reduced costs, and greater revenue.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

EPC Information Services (EPCIS) is a standard that enables different trading partners in the supply chain to capture and share data about the physical movement and status of items, usually serialized at the point of production. EPCIS 2.0 is the latest version of this standard, developed by [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/epcis), a global organization that develops, maintains, and enforces supply chain standards.

EPCIS 2.0 includes support for new kinds of business events and provides more flexibility in identifying and recording these events in a structured, machine-readable, and interoperable manner. The standard focuses on answering the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” associated with supply chain information, enabling seamless end-to-end visibility, traceability, and collaboration among all stakeholders involved in supply chain operations.

## What is CBV?

Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a companion standard to EPCIS, which standardizes the interpretation of EPCIS data by providing a more uniform and structured vocabulary for supply chain events, business procedures, and context information. CBV ensures that businesses can understand each other's data and collaborate effectively.

CBV promotes better data-quality, enhances traceability, and accelerates the adoption of EPCIS across a broad range of industries, including retail, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, logistics, and transportation.

## Why is EPCIS 2.0 important for businesses?

EPCIS 2.0 is crucial for businesses seeking to gain more visibility and control over their supply chains. Due to the evolving supply chain landscape, it is now more important than ever for companies to trace the origin, location, and movement of items throughout their supply chain, from sourcing to delivery.

Some of the key aspects that make EPCIS 2.0 essential for businesses are:

- Greater Data Granularity: EPCIS 2.0 allows capturing more detailed information about the supply chain. Each serialized item can be tracked individually, allowing businesses to monitor their inventory efficiently and prevent problems such as counterfeiting, theft, and spoilage.
- Improved Interoperability: EPCIS 2.0 facilitates seamless communication and data exchange among different trading partners, systems, and technologies in a supply chain. The standard enables businesses to easily integrate with suppliers and customers, and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
- Enhanced Visibility and Traceability: As an essential component of supply chain data, EPCIS 2.0 empowers businesses to gather accurate, up-to-date, and detailed information about their inventory, offering increased supply chain visibility and control.

## Why is CBV crucial for business growth?

CBV is essential for business growth because it provides a common language for EPCIS data across diverse industries, allowing companies to communicate efficiently and collaborate to achieve shared goals. CBV can contribute to business growth by:

- Enabling data sharing and collaboration among supply chain partners: Regardless of industry, CBV allows companies to communicate with each other by understanding the data being shared, leading to an improved supply chain.
- Enhancing decision-making: CBV ensures that businesses have a structured and standardized set of information, empowering managers to make informed decisions and react promptly to any changes in the supply chain.
- Reducing errors and miscommunication: CBV facilitates a uniform description of events and data in the supply chain, minimizing the risk of errors and miscommunication.
