## 1. Introduction

In today's fast-paced, data-driven world, knowing who, what, when, where, why, and how about your supply chain operations is crucial for efficiency and success. With ever-increasing regulatory requirements, the need for information exchange, and the growing complexities of global supply chains, it is essential for businesses to implement an effective data management solution that can improve product traceability, optimize resources, and strengthen partnerships.

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) are two such globally recognized, standardized frameworks that enable seamless information exchange between trading partners, organizations, and regulatory authorities. The EPCIS 2.0 and CBV have been designed to support a wide range of business cases, including APIs, EDI, IoT, Printing, Scanning, and RFID, making them an ideal fit for any organization looking to gain a competitive edge through improved supply chain visibility and traceability.

In this blog post, we will discuss the crucial steps to successfully implement EPCIS 2.0 and CBV in your organization and harness the full potential of these powerful data management frameworks.

## 2. Understanding EPCIS 2.0 and CBV

Before delving into the implementation process, you need to understand the fundamental concepts underpinning EPCIS 2.0 and CBV:

- **EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services)** is an open global standard that enables trading partners to capture and share event-based data about products as they move through the supply chain. It provides a unified framework that ensures interoperability of systems and enables better visibility, efficiency, and collaboration across the supply chain.

- **CBV (Core Business Vocabulary)** is an essential companion standard to EPCIS that provides a standard set of business meanings and relationships for EPCIS events. In other words, it offers a common language that trading partners can use while sharing and interpreting EPCIS data.

Together, EPCIS 2.0 and CBV enable organizations to effectively capture, share, and process information about products, supply chain events, and business processes, thereby improving supply chain visibility and traceability.
