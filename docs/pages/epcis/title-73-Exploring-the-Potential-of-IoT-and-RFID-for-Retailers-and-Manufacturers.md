## 1. Introduction

The world continues to experience rapid technological advancements that reshape various industries' operations, and the retail and manufacturing sectors are no exception. Internet of Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies, supported by APIs, EDI, printing, and scanning systems, have transformed retailers and manufacturers' operations. This article explores the potential of IoT, RFID, and the Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) 2.0, along with the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) in these sectors, highlighting their benefits, applications, barriers, and future prospects.

## 2. IoT, RFID, and EPCIS 2.0

IoT refers to interconnected devices within a network that can autonomously collect, process, and transmit data. RFID technology uses radio frequency to identify, track, and manage assets and inventory by attaching RFID tags to products. Meanwhile, EPCIS and CBV standards enable efficient visibility, traceability of products throughout the supply chain, providing a unified language for communication and data exchange among stakeholders.

## 7. Challenges and Barriers to Adoption

Despite the numerous benefits that these technologies offer, their adoption faces challenges such as:

1. High initial investment costs
2. Resistance to change by existing stakeholders
3. Security and privacy concerns
4. The need for technical expertise during implementation and maintenance
5. Integration with existing systems

Overcoming these challenges may require significant investment and a strategic, phased implementation approach.
