## 1. Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a global GS1 standard for creating and sharing visibility event data, both within and across companies, in the supply chain. It enables trading partners to share information about the physical movement and status of products as they travel throughout the supply chain - from business to business and ultimately to consumers. EPCIS 2.0, the latest version of the standard, brings significant improvements, additional features, and encompasses the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standard, offering a comprehensive solution for supply chain visibility.

This 5000-word blog post will dive deep into the EPCIS 2.0 and its features. We will examine the evolution of EPCIS from its initial conception to the latest version, explore the key features that make it an essential tool for businesses leveraging the latest technology, and illustrate its capabilities through a range of use cases across industries.

## 2. EPCIS 2.0: The Evolution <a id="epcis-2-0"></a>

EPCIS first emerged as a solution for tracking and tracing products using RFID technology and Electronic Product Codes (EPCs) to uniquely identify items in a supply chain. In its first version, EPCIS 1.0, the standard focused on simplifying the sharing of visibility event data across disparate systems and organizations. Since then, the use of EPCIS has expanded to several industries, including retail, healthcare, and transport, among others.

As the adoption of IoT devices, APIs, and EDI has increased, organizations have needed a more flexible system to integrate event data from these various sources. EPCIS 2.0 builds upon the robust foundation established by EPCIS 1.0, incorporating new functionalities to meet the growing demands of increasingly connected and complex supply chains.

The key differences between EPCIS 1.0 and EPCIS 2.0 include the merger of the EPCIS and CBV standards, as well as enhancements and new features that address emerging use cases and requirements. EPCIS 2.0 also incorporates feedback from stakeholders across different industries leading to a more versatile and scalable solution for businesses.

## 3. Key Features of EPCIS 2.0 <a id="key-features"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 offers a flexible and comprehensive solution for capturing, storing, and sharing visibility event data across supply chains. Here are some of the key features of EPCIS 2.0:

### 3.1 Enhanced Data Model

EPCIS 2.0 implements an enhanced data model that allows for greater flexibility when capturing and sharing supply chain event data. This updated data model supports capturing event data from various sources, including RFID, barcodes, IoT devices, and manual input, making it well-suited for the increasingly connected world.

### 3.2 Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) Integration

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a companion standard to EPCIS, providing a common language for describing various aspects of supply chain events in a standardized way. With EPCIS 2.0, CBV is now fully integrated into the EPCIS standard. This integration allows businesses to achieve a higher level of interoperability and consistency when capturing and sharing event data across different organizations and systems.

### 3.3 IoT Extensions

As the Internet of Things continues to expand, EPCIS 2.0 has embraced IoT technology, allowing for greater flexibility and support for capturing event data from IoT devices. This includes support for different types of sensing devices and integrating data from various IoT protocols and standards.

### 3.4 Enhanced Query Interface

The EPCIS 2.0 query interface has been enhanced to support a wider range of queries and filtering options, making it easier for users to find and retrieve the event data that's relevant to their needs. The query interface now also supports RESTful APIs, enabling businesses to integrate EPCIS easily with their existing systems.

### 3.5 Compliance and Certification

EPCIS 2.0 has been designed with compliance in mind, incorporating features that help businesses meet regulatory requirements across various industries, such as food safety, pharmaceutical tracking, and anticounterfeiting efforts. Additionally, EPCIS 2.0 includes a certification process, ensuring that solutions built on the standard are of high quality and meet the necessary criteria.

## 4. EPCIS 2.0 in Action: Use Cases <a id="use-cases"></a>

Let's explore some of the use cases that highlight the versatility and flexibility of EPCIS 2.0 in different industries.

### 4.1 Pharmaceutical Supply Chain

EPCIS 2.0 plays a significant role in ensuring the traceability and authenticity of pharmaceutical products, helping combat counterfeiting and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Pharmaceutical manufacturers can use EPCIS to capture and share event data for each stage of the product's journey, from manufacturing to distribution, and ultimately to the patient. Through EPCIS, stakeholders can verify the product's origin, handling, and storage conditions, ensuring the safety and efficacy of the medication.

### 4.2 Food Traceability

In the food industry, EPCIS 2.0 can be used to improve traceability and enhance food safety. By capturing and sharing event data along the supply chain, stakeholders can quickly trace the origin of a product and identify any issues that may arise. For example, if a batch of produce is found to be contaminated, EPCIS can be used to trace the source of the contamination and initiate a recall, effectively minimizing the risk to consumers.

### 4.3 Retail Supply Chain Optimization

EPCIS 2.0 can help retailers optimize their supply chain operations, providing visibility into the movement and status of products from suppliers to distribution centers and eventually to store shelves. By capturing and sharing event data through EPCIS, retailers can monitor inventory levels, minimize out-of-stock situations, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

### 4.4 Asset Tracking and Management

Across various industries, EPCIS 2.0 can be utilized for asset tracking and management, ensuring that valuable assets are accounted for and correctly utilized. By capturing and sharing event data related to asset movement, stakeholders can monitor the location and status of assets in real-time, enabling better decision-making and optimizing asset utilization.

## 5. Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

EPCIS 2.0 represents a significant advancement in supply chain visibility, offering a robust and flexible solution for businesses seeking to improve traceability, ensure compliance, and optimize operations. By combining key features such as an enhanced data model, IoT extensions, and the integration of CBV, EPCIS 2.0 is poised to become an essential tool for managing and sharing visibility event data across increasingly connected and complex supply chains.

Businesses leveraging EPCIS 2.0 will benefit from improved interoperability, ease of integration, and the ability to support a variety of use cases across industries. As industries continue to embrace digital transformation, EPCIS 2.0 will play a vital role in facilitating the sharing of critical event data, promoting supply chain transparency, and ensuring the safety and integrity of products worldwide.
