### 4. Direct-to-Garment Printing
Direct-to-garment (DTG) printing allows designs to be printed directly onto fabrics, offering unparalleled precision and vibrant colors. Retailers can use this technology to create unique, high-quality apparel with fewer limitations than traditional garment printing methods.

### 5. Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)
The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) enables secure and straightforward printing across networks, including cloud and remote printing for a wide range of devices. This innovation simplifies the process, saves time and resources, and ultimately streamlines business processes.

### 6. RFID Tags
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are integral to asset tracking and management, supply chain visibility, and inventory control. By utilizing radio waves, these tags store and transmit information regarding the identification and location of an item.

### 7. Active RFID Tags
These battery-powered RFID tags emit a continuous signal, making them ideal for real-time location tracking and extended range. They are primarily utilized in supply chain management, asset tracking, and healthcare equipment monitoring.

### 8. Passive RFID Tags
Passive RFID tags, which do not contain a battery, are powered by a connected RFID reader. The absence of a battery considerably reduces their size and cost, making them perfect for high-volume tracking applications such as inventory management and consumer goods tagging.

### 9. E-Pedigree Serialization System
Pharmaceutical companies can minimize counterfeit drugs and trace product origins by using the E-Pedigree Serialization System. This system uses RFID tags to store and transmit data securely, ensuring the drug supply chain remains transparent and efficient.

### 10. Enterprise Labeling
Enterprise labeling software centralizes and automates label creation, ensuring accuracy and consistency across an organization. This solution simplifies label management, reduces human error, and maintains compliance with industry regulations.

### 11. Portable Document Scanning
Portable document scanners improve efficiency and accessibility, allowing users to digitize documents on-the-go. They are frequently employed in remote work situations, sales, and in-field data collection.

### 12. Handheld Mobile Scanners
Handheld mobile scanners are equipped with advanced scanning capabilities, enabling users to capture data more swiftly and accurately. They can instantly read barcodes, QR codes, and text, often integrating with smartphones or tablets for increased functionality.

### 13. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
OCR technology scans printed or handwritten text, converting it into machine-readable digital format. This innovation streamlines the storage, retrieval, and modification of text-based documents, reducing human error and increasing efficiency in data entry tasks.

### 14. QR Code Scanning
QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes containing data in both horizontal and vertical patterns. They offer significant storage capacity, quick readability, and seamless decoding, making them perfect for contactless payments, advertising, and asset tracking.

### 15. Machine Vision Technology
Machine vision takes scanning to the next level by employing artificial intelligence and data processing capabilities to analyze and interpret images. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture can leverage this innovation for defect detection, quality control, and automation.

### 16. ID Card Scanning
ID card scanning technology can verify and authenticate identification documents on-the-spot. This innovation is helpful for security applications, age verification, and access control, significantly reducing the risk of fraud.

### 17. License Plate Recognition (LPR)
LPR technology scans and interprets license plates, providing real-time monitoring for law enforcement, parking management, and security applications. The ability to automate and streamline identification enhances efficiency and leads to more effective operations.
