## 1. Introduction
Data exchange and interoperability have become increasingly important in modern supply chain management. Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is a GS1 Standard that enables different organizations to capture and share data about their products, providing end-to-end visibility in the supply chain. With the introduction of EPCIS 2.0, new features and capabilities have been introduced, transforming data exchange for businesses worldwide in this interconnected landscape.

## 2. Foundations: EPCIS 1.2 and Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)
EPCIS was first introduced as a specification in 2007, and the latest version, EPCIS 1.2, was adopted as an international standard (ISO/IEC 19987) in 2018. EPCIS enables supply chain partners to capture events—such as the commissioning, shipping, receiving, and decommissioning of products—and share this information with each other.

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is another standard, developed closely in conjunction with EPCIS. CBV defines a standardized list of event types, object classes, and event data fields, which allows various organizations to use a common language when exchanging data.

Together, EPCIS and CBV provide the foundation for data exchange along the supply chain using common frameworks.

## 3. The Evolution: EPCIS 2.0 and What's New
EPCIS 2.0 introduces a range of enhancements and new features designed to maintain compatibility with existing systems while enabling novel use cases and improving flexibility. Key updates in EPCIS 2.0 include:

1. **Digital Link Integration**: EPCIS 2.0 integrates GS1 Digital Link, which unifies EPC representations with QR Codes and NFC tags. This simplifies the encoding of EPC information, enabling seamless information accessibility.
2. **Sensor Support**: The new version adds support for reporting IoT sensor-based data, allowing the capture of environmental information and other parameters critical to supply chain management.
3. **Flexible Data Model**: EPCIS 2.0 improves the flexibility of the data model, supporting a broader range of business use cases and accommodating complex attributes.
4. **RESTful Web Services**: The latest version introduces RESTful web services, simplifying the implementation and consumption of EPCIS services.

## 4. APIs and EPCIS 2.0
APIs are essential for efficient data exchange between applications and other systems. EPCIS 2.0 enables simplified data exchange using RESTful APIs, which support JSON-LD payloads compatible with the Semantic Web. EPCIS 2.0 also includes support for GraphQL, allowing developers to tailor their API requests to include only necessary data, reducing the complexity and overhead of managing data exchange.

## 5. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and EPCIS 2.0
EDI is a specialized messaging format for the electronic exchange of business information among supply chain partners. EPCIS events are a perfect complement to EDI, as they offer real-time information exchange between organizations. Integrating EPCIS 2.0 with existing EDI transactions allows businesses to leverage electronic documents for efficient order processing, streamlining supply chain operations in a way that meets regulatory requirements.

## 6. Internet of Things (IoT) and EPCIS Integration
IoT devices, such as sensors and beacons, can collect real-time data that provides valuable insights into the state of the supply chain. EPCIS 2.0 allows IoT sensor data to be captured and shared, enabling businesses to monitor environmental conditions and external factors affecting their products. This enhances supply chain visibility and provides an additional layer of data for analytics and decision-making.

## 7. Printing, Scanning, and RFID in the Supply Chain
EPCIS 2.0 supports a wide range of technologies used in the product identification process. The inclusion of GS1 Digital Link promotes the standardization of encoding EPCs in QR Codes, NFC tags, and traditional barcodes. The increased interoperability between printing, scanning, and RAIN RFID systems ensures that a more comprehensive and secure view of the supply chain is achieved, reducing potential errors and inefficiencies.

## 8. Conclusion: The Future of EPCIS and Data Exchange
The advancements in EPCIS 2.0 have a transformative impact on supply chain management, enabling effortless connectivity and data sharing across organizations. The integration with APIs, EDI, IoT devices, and identification technologies such as Printing, Scanning, and RFID ensures a secure, efficient, and compliant supply chain that meets the demands of a global, digital landscape. As we progress, it is clear that EPCIS 2.0 will play a critical role in shaping the future of supply chain management and data exchange.
