## <a id="introduction"></a> 1. Introduction to CBV and EPCIS 2.0

### 1.1 Core Business Vocabulary (CBV)

The Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) is a standardized set of terms, values, and definitions that enable businesses to exchange data effectively and consistently. It provides a structured and consistent language for businesses to share and interpret supply chain data across different technologies and platforms, such as APIs, EDI, IoT, Printing, Scanning, and RFID.

CBV plays a vital role in improving visibility across the supply chain, facilitating actionable insights, and streamlining processes. By providing a consistent vocabulary, businesses can now communicate seamlessly and accurately about data related to their products, processes, and events.

### 1.2 Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) 2.0

EPCIS is a GS1 standard that provides an infrastructure for businesses to collect, store, and share data about the movement of objects and their associated details in the supply chain. 

The recent release of EPCIS 2.0 marks a significant milestone for data exchange and compatibility. This latest version expands upon its predecessor's capabilities by incorporating additional features and support for new technologies such as IoT, APIs, and EDI. Furthermore, EPCIS 2.0 now natively integrates with CBV, ensuring a consistent and accurate exchange of product and event data.

## <a id="effects"></a> 2. CBV's Effects on Data Exchange

CBV greatly impacts data exchange by facilitating:

### 2.1 Improved Data Interoperability

The implementation of CBV across various systems ensures that all parties involved in the supply chain can understand and interpret data effectively, even if their systems differ. This level of interoperability not only reduces the likelihood of errors and data discrepancies but also expedites communication and data exchange between businesses.

### 2.2 Streamlined Processes

A standardized vocabulary across different technologies and platforms eliminates the need for manual data transformation or manipulation. This minimizes potential human error and simplifies the overall data management process.

### 2.3 Enhanced Data Analysis & Decision Making

The EPCIS 2.0 and CBV framework provides businesses with high-quality, standardized data, enabling more accurate data analysis and decision-making. The ability to gather actionable insights from data consistently allows businesses to optimize their supply chain processes, improve product quality, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## <a id="compatibility"></a> 3. Achieving Technological Compatibility

By incorporating CBV within various technologies, businesses can benefit from enhanced compatibility and streamlined data sharing between different systems, such as APIs, EDI, IoT, Printing, Scanning, and RFID.

### 3.1 APIs

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow different systems to communicate and share data. By adopting CBV for APIs, businesses can ensure seamless data exchange between different applications, improving the efficiency of their supply chain.

### 3.2 EDI

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a method of exchanging structured data between trading partners. The integration of CBV in EDI enables more accurate and efficient communication between partners and streamlines the data exchange process.

### 3.3 IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of connected devices that can share data and information across networks. By incorporating CBV into IoT systems, businesses can effectively utilize data gathered from various sources and ensure the interoperability of their devices.

### 3.4 Printing & Scanning

CBV standardizes data interpretation between printed barcodes, QR codes, and other data carriers. By adopting CBV, businesses can ensure that scanning and printing technologies provide consistent and accurate data throughout the supply chain.

### 3.5 RFID

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology utilizes radio waves to read and capture data stored on tags that can be attached to products. The implementation of CBV in RFID systems ensures that businesses can effectively capture and share data throughout the supply chain.
