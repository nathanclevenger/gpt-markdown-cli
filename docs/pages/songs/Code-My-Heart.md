# Code My Heart: An Ode to the Frustrations of Debugging

Verse 1:
I was writing lines of code, my computer was my friend
I thought I had it all, until the program reached its end
The bugs came crawling out, they were hiding in the code
I felt so lost and hopeless, they were such a heavy load

Chorus:
Code my heart, break it into parts
Line by line, I thought I had it fine
But now I see, the bugs are haunting me
Code my heart, why won't it start?

Verse 2:
I tried to fix the errors, I tried with all my might
But every time I found a bug, another came in sight
I googled and I debugged, until my eyes were sore
But nothing seemed to work, I felt like such a bore

Chorus:
Code my heart, break it into parts
Line by line, I thought I had it fine
But now I see, the bugs are haunting me
Code my heart, why won't it start?

Bridge:
I thought I could make it, thought I was so smart
But now I see the truth, debugging's an art
It takes patience and skill, and time and some more
But in the end it pays off, and you hear the code's roar

Chorus:
Code my heart, break it into parts
Line by line, I thought I had it fine
But now I see, the bugs are haunting me
Code my heart, why won't it start?

Verse 3:
Now the code is running, it's amazing to see
All the bugs are gone, it's as it's meant to be
I feel a sense of pride, in what I have achieved
And all the time and effort, I don't feel deceived

Chorus:
Code my heart, break it into parts
Line by line, I thought I had it fine
But now I see, the bugs are haunting me
Code my heart, why won't it start?

Outro:
So if you're a programmer, and feel like giving up
Just remember this song, and that you're not a schmuck
Debugging's not easy, it takes lots of heart
But in the end it pays off, and you'll feel like a work of art.
