# The Next Big Thing: A Song About the Excitement (and Challenges) of Startup Life

Verse 1:
It all starts with an idea, a spark in your mind
You feel the electricity, the thrill of the find
You know this could be it, the thing the world needs
So you gather your team, and plant the startup seeds

Chorus:
We're the next big thing, the startup dream team
Building something from nothing, it's the ultimate scheme
We'll change the world, disrupt the whole game
We're the next big thing, and we're not the same

Verse 2:
The early days are tough, you're stretched real thin
There's no guarantee, but you're too far in
You're working round the clock, pushing through the grind
It feels like you're living in a constant bind

Chorus:
We're the next big thing, the startup dream team
Building something from nothing, it's the ultimate scheme
We'll change the world, disrupt the whole game
We're the next big thing, and we're not the same

Bridge:
You're chasing that funding, your eyes on the prize
The stress and the pressure, it's no surprise
But you know it's worth it, you believe in your cause
You'll do whatever it takes, because you're not about to pause

Verse 3:
The product's coming together, you can feel the buzz
Your team's firing on all cylinders, no longer just because
The world is talking, you're the talk of the town
You can't keep up with the demand, you're hiring all around

Chorus:
We're the next big thing, the startup dream team
Building something from nothing, it's the ultimate scheme
We'll change the world, disrupt the whole game
We're the next big thing, and we're not the same

Bridge:
The ride is wild, but you're on this high
You knew it was coming, but couldn't quantify
You're grateful for the journey, the highs and the lows
The lessons learned, the mistakes, how it all goes

Verse 4:
The sky's the limit, you're reaching for the stars
You've come so far, it all feels so bizarre
You're leaving your mark, you're shaping the world
You're changing the game, you're that startup unfurled

Chorus:
We're the next big thing, the startup dream team
Building something from nothing, it's the ultimate scheme
We'll change the world, disrupt the whole game
We're the next big thing, and we're not the same

Outro:
You may have started as an idea, a spark in your mind
But you're now the next big thing, and there's no rewind
You're part of a community, of risk-takers and dreamers
The excitement of startup life, is that next big thing beamer.
