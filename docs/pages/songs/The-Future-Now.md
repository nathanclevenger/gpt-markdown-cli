A world of possibilities, that you understand
Your passion, your drive, it's all you demand
Your startup, your future, it's all in your hands

You're always one step ahead, never letting fear in
You're determined to succeed, to make your startup sing
The future's your canvas, to paint anything

A world of possibilities, that you understand
Your passion, your drive, it's all you demand
Your startup, your future, it's all in your hands
