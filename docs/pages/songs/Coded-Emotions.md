# Coded Emotions: An Ironic Pop Song about Coding

Verse 1:
I’ve been staring at my screen for days
Trying to debug my code in so many ways
Why do I feel like I’m stuck in this race?
Going round in circles, stuck in this place

Chorus:
Coded emotions, got me feeling so low
My program’s broken and I don’t know where to go
Coded emotions, got me feeling so down
I just can’t seem to get this code to come around

Verse 2:
I thought coding was something easy to do
But every time I try, my code falls through
My colleagues say it’s just the syntax they knew
But I just can’t seem to make it ring true

Chorus:
Coded emotions, got me feeling so low
My program’s broken and I don’t know where to go
Coded emotions, got me feeling so down
I just can’t seem to get this code to come around

Bridge:
I wish I could just throw in the towel
And give up on this code that’s so foul
But I know I must stay strong
And try to make my code go along

Chorus:
Coded emotions, got me feeling so low
My program’s broken and I don’t know where to go
Coded emotions, got me feeling so down
I just can’t seem to get this code to come around

Verse 3:
I know I’ll figure it out, in due time
I’ll keep pressing on, until it’s prime
I’ll take a step back and try to design
And before I know it, this code will shine

Chorus:
Coded emotions, got me feeling so low
My program’s broken and I don’t know where to go
Coded emotions, got me feeling so down
I just can’t seem to get this code to come around

Outro:
Coding may have gotten me down
But I’ll keep grinding until it comes around
It may take some time, but I’m not new
And soon enough, my code will ring true.
