# Love Encoded: An Ironic Pop Song About Coding

Verse 1:
I met a guy, he was coding all night,
He said he loved me, and that felt alright,
But then he told me, that he loved his code more,
I thought it'd be trendy, but I ended up sore.

Pre-Chorus:
He tried to teach me, of functions and strings,
I tried to learn it, but couldn't feel a thing.

Chorus:
Can't you see, that you're not what I need,
All your code, it's like a wall between,
Our love is lost, in your tabs and your screens,
Love encoded, it's not what it seems.

Verse 2:
He'd stay up all night, writing line after line,
He told me he was working, but something wasn't right,
I'd see his eyes gleaming, with each curly brace,
I thought he was dreaming, but he was stuck in a trace.

Pre-Chorus:
He tried to show me, of HTML and CSS,
But it just wasn't me, I was feeling the stress.

Chorus:
Can't you see, that you're not what I need,
All your code, it's like a wall between,
Our love is lost, in your tabs and your screens,
Love encoded, it's not what it seems.

Bridge:
I thought we had it all, when we first met,
But now I see, that code was his real bet,
He loved his syntax, his functions and all,
But I needed a love, that could stand tall.

Chorus:
Can't you see, that you're not what I need,
All your code, it's like a wall between,
Our love is lost, in your tabs and your screens,
Love encoded, it's not what it seems.

Outro:
Love encoded, it's not what I need,
I need a love, that's not in between,
I'll find someone, who'll love me for me,
Love decoded, that's what it'll be.
