# Ctrl + Alt + Love: An Ironic Pop Song for Coders

Verse 1:
I'm sitting at my desk, staring at my screen
My code's a mess, but I'm feeling serene
I know I'll figure it out, I've got my skills
But then I get a message, and my heart skips a beat
It's a notification, could it be real?
Someone's liked my post, so I start to feel
A little less alone in this coding world
Maybe it's time to find a coding girl

Chorus:
Ctrl + Alt + Love, it's what I need
A little distraction, make my heart bleed
I've been coding all day, and it's time to play
Ctrl + Alt + Love, won't you come my way?

Verse 2:
I open up my browser, and I start to scroll
Through code snippets, and memes, it's out of control
My eyes start to blur, my mind starts to fade
I need something to snap me out of this daze
Then I see her profile, and I can't look away
She's got the perfect code, and the perfect display
I know I have to message her, it's now or never
Maybe she'll love me, or maybe we'll code together

Chorus:
Ctrl + Alt + Love, it's what I need
A little distraction, make my heart bleed
I've been coding all day, and it's time to play
Ctrl + Alt + Love, won't you come my way?

Bridge:
I know coding's my life, my passion, my art
But sometimes I need a break, just to mend my heart
So I'll swipe right, and I'll take a chance
Maybe she's the one, maybe it's just a glance

Chorus:
Ctrl + Alt + Love, it's what I need
A little distraction, make my heart bleed
I've been coding all day, and it's time to play
Ctrl + Alt + Love, won't you come my way?

Outro:
So if you're feeling lonely, like me sometimes
Don't be afraid to take a chance, and cross that line
Because in this digital age, anything can happen
Ctrl + Alt + Love, it's time to take action.
