# Infinite Loop of Love: A Coding Love Story

Verse 1:
I remember when I first laid eyes on you
My code was running smoothly, but my heart was askew
You walked in with your syntax so fine
My IDE froze, I knew you'd be mine

Chorus:
Infinite loop of love, my heart can't break free
Compiling my feelings, but you're all I see
I'd debug for hours just to make you smile
Infinite loop of love, let's stay awhile

Verse 2:
We'd stay up all night, typing away
Discussing algorithms 'til the break of day
Your curly braces, just like your hair
I couldn't help but admire and stare

Chorus:
Infinite loop of love, my heart can't break free
Compiling my feelings, but you're all I see
I'd debug for hours just to make you smile
Infinite loop of love, let's stay awhile

Bridge:
Our love was like an open-source project
Collaboration, always in respect
We'd push and pull, but never merge
Our code was tight, always on the verge

Chorus:
Infinite loop of love, my heart can't break free
Compiling my feelings, but you're all I see
I'd debug for hours just to make you smile
Infinite loop of love, let's stay awhile

Verse 3:
But then one day, a syntax error occurred
Our code was broken, our love deferred
Our functions clashed, our loops diverged
Our relationship, forever submerged

Chorus:
Infinite loop of love, my heart can't break free
Compiling my feelings, but you're all I see
I'd debug for hours just to make you smile
Infinite loop of love, we'll reconcile

Outro:
Despite the bugs and segmentation faults
Our love remains, always in default
We'll debug and test, and then compile
Infinite loop of love, let's stay awhile.
