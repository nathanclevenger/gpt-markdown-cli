# Love Loop: An Ironic Pop Song about Coding

Verse 1:
I'm stuck in a love loop  
Can't break free, can't recoup  
My code is clean, but my heart's a mess  
I'm lost in love, I confess  

Chorus:
Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V  
Repeat my love, constantly  
Like a program that just won't quit  
I'm in a love loop, can't admit  

Verse 2:
I thought coding was my one true love  
But now I realize, it's just a crutch  
I spend all day, typing away  
But at night, thoughts of you won't stray  

Chorus:
Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V  
Repeat my love, constantly  
Like a program that just won't quit  
I'm in a love loop, can't admit  

Bridge:
Maybe I need to debug my heart  
Find the lines that are tearing me apart  
Or maybe it's just a coding phase  
And in time, my heart will realign  

Chorus:
Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V  
Repeat my love, constantly  
Like a program that just won't quit  
I'm in a love loop, can't admit  

Outro:
Love loop, love loop  
Can't break free, can't recoup  
Maybe one day, I'll find my way  
Out of this love loop, and into a brighter day.
