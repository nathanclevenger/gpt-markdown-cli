# The Visionary Way: A Song for Startup Life

Verse 1:
In the world of startups, it's a game we play
A visionary way, each and every day
We see the future like no one else can see
Creating something new, changing history

Chorus:
The visionary way, it's not for the faint of heart
It's a path less traveled, where the real work starts
We have a vision, to change the world one day
It's the journey that counts, on the visionary way

Verse 2:
We start with an idea, a flicker in our mind
A product or service that we want to find
We take that vision and we build our team
Working together, chasing the startup dream

Chorus:
The visionary way, it's not for the faint of heart
It's a path less traveled, where the real work starts
We have a vision, to change the world one day
It's the journey that counts, on the visionary way

Bridge:
We face obstacles, but we push through
We make mistakes, but we learn too
With each pivot, our vision grows
We're making progress, watch how it shows

Chorus:
The visionary way, it's not for the faint of heart
It's a path less traveled, where the real work starts
We have a vision, to change the world one day
It's the journey that counts, on the visionary way

Verse 3:
We're not afraid to fail, we take risks
We trust the process, as our vision persists
We see opportunity where others see none
That's the visionary mindset, we can't be outdone

Chorus:
The visionary way, it's not for the faint of heart
It's a path less traveled, where the real work starts
We have a vision, to change the world one day
It's the journey that counts, on the visionary way

Outro:
The visionary way, it's not for everyone
But for those who dare, the journey has just begun
We're changing the world, one startup at a time
The visionary way, it's a way of life, sublime.
