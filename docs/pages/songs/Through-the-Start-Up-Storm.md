# Through the Start-Up Storm: A Song for the Entrepreneurial Journey

Verse 1:
Started off with just an idea,
A dream that sparked a fire in my soul.
I didn't know what was ahead,
But I was ready to take control.

Chorus:
Through the start-up storm,
I'll weather every blow.
I'll push through until I've formed,
My own pathway that will glow.

Verse 2:
I had to dig deep within,
To find the strength to persevere.
Put doubts behind, and trust in myself,
And always face every fear.

Chorus:
Through the start-up storm,
I'll weather every blow.
I'll push through until I've formed,
My own pathway that will glow.

Bridge:
I won't fall, I won't break,
I'll stand tall with no mistake,
I'll embrace the struggle and pain,
Until the triumph comes again.

Chorus:
Through the start-up storm,
I'll weather every blow.
I'll push through until I've formed,
My own pathway that will glow.

Verse 3:
The journey has been tough,
But I'm not giving up.
I'll keep going until I've won,
And achieved my success with a jump.

Chorus:
Through the start-up storm,
I'll weather every blow.
I'll push through until I've formed,
My own pathway that will glow.

Outro:
With every step that I take,
I'll remember this start-up song.
Through the storm, I'll keep going,
Till my dream has finally come along.
