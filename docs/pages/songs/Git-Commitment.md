#Git Commitment 

Verse 1:   
Once upon a time  
There was a programmer so fine  
He was great with code  
Creating systems that would just explode  

Chorus:   
But his love life was illogical  
As he couldn't seem to get meaningful  
Finally, he found the culprit  
It was his Git Commitment  

Verse 2:  
Everyday he'd commit  
A line of code here and there  
Never had time for anything else  
No friends, no hobbies, not even a tiny long walk  

Chorus:   
But his love life was illogical  
As he couldn't seem to get meaningful  
Finally, he found the culprit  
It was his Git Commitment  

Bridge:    
He had to decide what to choose  
Should he stay single forever?  
No way, there must be some balance  
Between code and romance  

Chorus:   
But his love life was illogical  
As he couldn't seem to get meaningful  
Finally, he found the culprit  
It was his Git Commitment  

Verse 3:   
He decided to make a change  
That girl he met, he found sane  
He started to code less  
And focused on love and tenderness  

Chorus:   
His love life became logical  
Instead of just being technological  
Finally, he found the perfect fit  
When he balanced Git Commitment  

Outro:   
Now he has it all  
Code and love standing tall  
So listen up all you coders  
Don't let Git Commitment take over!
