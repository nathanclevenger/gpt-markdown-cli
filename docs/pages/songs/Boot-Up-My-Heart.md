# Boot Up My Heart: The Anthem for Coding Enthusiasts

As we sit in front of our computers for countless hours, typing away at our keyboards, lines of code making sense only to us, it's easy to forget the passion that drove us to this field. But fear not, my fellow coders, for we have a new anthem that will remind us of the burning fire in our hearts for computer science. Introducing "Boot Up My Heart" - the ultimate ironic pop song for every coding enthusiast.

Verse 1:
From the moment I saw a computer screen,
I knew that coding was for me.
I learned to type, to debug and compile,
And soon enough, I found my style.

Pre-chorus:
I write code with passion and love,
There's nothing more that I'm thinking of.
With each line, I'm closer to my goal,
My heart is racing, I'm in control.

Chorus:
Boot up my heart, with passion and fire,
I'll code all night, until I expire.
My love for coding is strong and true,
There's nothing I'd rather do.

Verse 2:
I know the language like the back of my hand,
I can write scripts faster than lightning strikes land.
My friends may call me a computer geek,
But I know my skills are always on fleek.

Pre-chorus:
I write code with passion and love,
There's nothing more that I'm thinking of.
With each line, I'm closer to my goal,
My heart is racing, I'm in control.

Chorus:
Boot up my heart, with passion and fire,
I'll code all night, until I expire.
My love for coding is strong and true,
There's nothing I'd rather do.

Bridge:
I may not be a rockstar or a musician,
But I know my code can shift the competition.
With each line, I'm building a platform for success,
My love for coding is more than a fleeting interest.

Chorus:
Boot up my heart, with passion and fire,
I'll code all night, until I expire.
My love for coding is strong and true,
There's nothing I'd rather do.

Outro:
So let us raise our keyboards high,
And show the world our pride.
With every code, we prove our worth,
Our passion for coding will till death do us part.

In conclusion, "Boot Up My Heart" is not just an ironic pop song, but an anthem that will ignite the passion for coding in every IT enthusiast. So, my fellow developers, let us play this song loud and proud, and let the world know that coding is not just a job, but a way of life.
