# Algorithmic Attraction

Verse 1:
I was lost in code, feeling quite dismayed
My passion for programming had all but decayed
Then I met a function, so efficient and precise
It sparked a flame inside me, like a digital device

Chorus:
Algorithmic attraction, it's a new type of love
My heart beats in binary, my thoughts revolve
Around the syntax and the structure, every line and loop
My programming obsession, it's not a fluke

Verse 2:
I used to spend my nights, dreaming of the stars
But now I dream in code, with syntax so bizarre
At first I thought I'd gone insane, but then I saw the light
I found my true love in a computer's byte

Chorus:
Algorithmic attraction, it's a new type of love
My heart beats in binary, my thoughts revolve
Around the syntax and the structure, every line and loop
My programming obsession, it's not a fluke

Bridge:
Some may say it's odd, to love lines of code
But to me it's beautiful, like a painting by Monet
My mind dances with every character and semicolon
And I know that I will never feel alone

Chorus:
Algorithmic attraction, it's a new type of love
My heart beats in binary, my thoughts revolve
Around the syntax and the structure, every line and loop
My programming obsession, it's not a fluke

Verse 3:
I've found my purpose, my passion, my drive
I'll never look back, my programming heart is alive
My love for coding, it grows with every line
It's like a symphony, with every algorithmic rhyme

Chorus:
Algorithmic attraction, it's a new type of love
My heart beats in binary, my thoughts revolve
Around the syntax and the structure, every line and loop
My programming obsession, it's not a fluke

Outro:
So if you're lost in code, feeling uninspired,
Just keep on typing, eventually you'll find the fire
Algorithmic attraction, it's the love that we share,
It may seem a bit robotic, but it's always there.
