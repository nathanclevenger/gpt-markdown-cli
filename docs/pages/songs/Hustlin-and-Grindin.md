## Verse 1

From the early mornin' till the late at night  
Puttin' in work, it's my only delight  
Pushin' pixels and code, till the hack's just right  
Hustlin' and grindin', through the day and night

Hustlin' and grindin', that's all we know  
Start-up life, is our only goal  
Our dreams so big, but we won't let go  
Hustlin' and grindin', till we reach our goal

## Verse 2

No rest for the wicked, no time for sleep  
Our competitors slumber, while we strive to beat  
Ideas pouring down like rain, we capture them with our brain  
Hustlin' and grindin', is the only way to gain

## Chorus

Hustlin' and grindin', that's all we know  
Start-up life, is our only goal  
Our dreams so big, but we won't let go

## Verse 3

Investors say "no", but we keep on goin'  
Every "no" makes us stronger, our resolve keeps growin'  
The climb to the top is steep and long  
Our team is tough, we're unstoppable, we're strong

## Bridge

Some days it feels like we're on top of the world  
Other days we get knocked down, it's a brutal swirl  
But we pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off  
We're ready for anything, we're tough, we're smart, we're scoffed

Our dreams so big, but we won't let go  
Hustlin' and grindin', till we reach our goal

The start-up life is not for the faint of heart  
We often feel like targets, with arrows in our cart  
But we keep pushin' forward, with our heads held high  
Hustlin' and grindin', we're unstoppable, we're alive

## Chorus

Hustlin' and grindin', that's all we know  
Start-up life, is our only goal  
Our dreams so big, but we won't let go  
Hustlin' and grindin', till we reach our goal

## Outro

So to all our fellow entrepreneurs, this one's for you  
Hustlin' and grindin', it's what we do  
Our days are long, our nights are short  
But we'll keep pushin' forward, we'll never abort

Hustlin' and grindin', till we reach the top  
Our dreams won't die, they'll never stop  
So let's keep pushin' forward, with all our might  
Hustlin' and grindin', till it all feels right.
