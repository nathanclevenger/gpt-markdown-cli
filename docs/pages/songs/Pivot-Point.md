# Pivot Point: The Song of Startup Life

Verse 1:
Starting up a new business, it’s a path we choose
Chasing big dreams, with nothing to lose
We build from scratch, brick by brick
Our passion, our drive, our spirit, we mix

Chorus:
Pivot point, a moment in time
A turning point, we’ll make it shine
We’ll change our course, we’ll change our view
Pivot point, we’ll break through

Verse 2:
Days are long, nights are short
We work harder, we push harder, we strive for sport
We learn, we fail, we rise again
Our hunger never fades, our ambition never wanes 

Chorus:
Pivot point, a moment in time
A turning point, we’ll make it shine
We’ll change our course, we’ll change our view
Pivot point, we’ll break through

Bridge:
We face our fears, we face the truth
We chase our vision, we break the booth
We sail the ship, through stormy seas
We fight the odds, we make it free

Chorus:
Pivot point, a moment in time
A turning point, we’ll make it shine
We’ll change our course, we’ll change our view
Pivot point, we’ll break through

Verse 3:
Success is elusive, but we’ll never quit
We’ll grind, we’ll hustle, we’ll never admit defeat
We’ll surround ourselves, with a team of stars
Our faith, our trust, our bond never jars

Chorus:
Pivot point, a moment in time
A turning point, we’ll make it shine
We’ll change our course, we’ll change our view
Pivot point, we’ll break through

Outro:
Pivot point, a moment of truth
A leap of faith, a time to soothe
Our destiny, we’ll mold and weave
Our startup journey, we’ll surely achieve.
