# The Entrepreneur's Anthem: A Song for Startup Life

Verse 1:
I wake up before the sun
To chase my dreams before day is done
I've got a vision and a plan
And the will to make it stand

Chorus:
This is the entrepreneur's anthem
A song for the startup life
We're carving a path to greatness
Building something that shines bright

Verse 2:
There are days when it's tough
But I've got this fire burning deep enough
I won't back down or give up
I'll show the world what I'm made of

Chorus:
This is the entrepreneur's anthem
A song for the startup life
We're carving a path to greatness
Building something that shines bright

Bridge:
We take risks and we innovate
We fail and we learn to make our fate
We work hard and we play hard too
This journey's tough, but we'll see it through

Chorus:
This is the entrepreneur's anthem
A song for the startup life
We're carving a path to greatness
Building something that shines bright

Verse 3:
I'm not in this for the money
But it's nice when things get sunny
I believe in my idea
And the impact it will bring here

Chorus:
This is the entrepreneur's anthem
A song for the startup life
We're carving a path to greatness
Building something that shines bright

Outro:
I'll keep grinding, I'll keep hustling
I'll keep dreaming and I'll keep believing
This is the entrepreneur's anthem
And it's just the beginning
