# Syntax Error in Love: An Ironic Pop Song for Coders

Verse 1:
I met you in the code,
A line of Python and you were the ode.
You made my program run,
But now my heart’s come undone.
I thought our love was true,
But now I see it’s just a syntax error, who knew?

Chorus:
Syntax error in love,
My heart’s code is corrupt.
I thought you were my bug fix,
But now you’re just a syntax mix.
I tried to debug our love,
But it’s time to terminate, I’ve had enough.

Verse 2:
We had a great connection,
But now all I see is segmentation.
Our love was running smoothly,
But then came a null entry.
I thought we could fix the bug,
But now my heart’s just a code thug.

Chorus:
Syntax error in love,
My heart’s code is corrupt.
I thought you were my bug fix,
But now you’re just a syntax mix.
I tried to debug our love,
But it’s time to terminate, I’ve had enough.

Bridge:
I’ll find someone who understands,
My code and my commands.
Someone who won’t crash,
Or give me an infinite loop to stash.

Chorus:
Syntax error in love,
My heart’s code is corrupt.
I thought you were my bug fix,
But now you’re just a syntax mix.
I tried to debug our love,
But it’s time to terminate, I’ve had enough.

Outro:
So goodbye to you, my love in code,
I'll move on to a better encoding mode.
I'll find a love that's debug-free,
Someone who will input the best in me.
