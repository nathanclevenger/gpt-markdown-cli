# Innovate or Perish: A Song for Startup Life

Verse 1:
Standing at the crossroads, where do we go from here?
We've got a million ideas but not enough ears to hear
We know we've got to change it up if we want to survive
We can't keep doing the same thing and expect to thrive

Chorus:
Innovate or perish, that's the message loud and clear
We've got to take some risks if we want to persevere
We'll be the ones to lead the way, we'll be the pioneers
Innovate or perish, it's the mantra for our years

Verse 2:
We can't rely on what's worked in the past
Our competitors are catching up fast
We need to push the boundaries, think outside the box
Come up with something new that will really make them talk

Chorus:
Innovate or perish, that's the message loud and clear
We've got to take some risks if we want to persevere
We'll be the ones to lead the way, we'll be the pioneers
Innovate or perish, it's the mantra for our years

Bridge:
The road ahead won't be easy, we know that for a fact
But with persistence and hard work, we'll keep our startup intact
We'll embrace the challenges, learn from our mistakes
And when we face obstacles, we'll never hit the brakes

Chorus:
Innovate or perish, that's the message loud and clear
We've got to take some risks if we want to persevere
We'll be the ones to lead the way, we'll be the pioneers
Innovate or perish, it's the mantra for our years

Verse 3:
We'll work around the clock, pour our hearts into the game
And when we reach the top, we'll never be the same
Our products will change the world, customers will cheer in delight
We'll have made our mark, and we'll know we've done it right

Chorus:
Innovate or perish, that's the message loud and clear
We've got to take some risks if we want to persevere
We'll be the ones to lead the way, we'll be the pioneers
Innovate or perish, it's the mantra for our years

Outro:
So let's band together, create something new
Innovate or perish, it's what we've got to do
Our startup lies ahead, we've got nothing to fear
We'll embrace the challenge, innovate or perish, it's the song for our years.
