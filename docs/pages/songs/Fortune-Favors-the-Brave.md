# Fortune Favors the Brave: A Song for Startup Life

Verse 1:
I wake up early in the morning
Another day, another chance
To take on challenges, keep moving
‘Cause that’s how startups advance

I check my emails and my messages
I look for signals, trends, and signs
I analyze the market, competitors
I strategize, I organize

Chorus:
Fortune favors the brave
It’s not luck, it’s who we are
We take risks, we innovate
We hustle hard, we go far

Verse 2:
I meet with investors, I pitch our story
I show them what we have achieved
I share our vision, our mission, our values
And how we plan to succeed

They ask me questions, they challenge my assumptions
They want to know the risks and the rewards
I answer truthfully, confidently
‘Cause I believe in what we’re building towards

Chorus:
Fortune favors the brave
It’s not luck, it’s who we are
We take risks, we innovate
We hustle hard, we go far

Bridge:
Yes, we face setbacks, we encounter obstacles
We make mistakes, we learn from them
We pivot, we iterate, we evolve
‘Cause that’s how startups thrive and stem

Chorus:
Fortune favors the brave
It’s not luck, it’s who we are
We take risks, we innovate
We hustle hard, we go far

Verse 3:
I work with a team of talented people
Who share my passion, my determination
We collaborate, we communicate
We celebrate our milestones and innovation

We know that time is precious, resources limited
We prioritize, we optimize, we focus
We stay agile, we stay resilient
‘Cause that’s how startups cope with the hocus-pocus

Chorus:
Fortune favors the brave
It’s not luck, it’s who we are
We take risks, we innovate
We hustle hard, we go far

Outro:
I go to bed late at night
Another day, another accomplishment
I reflect on what we’ve achieved
And what we’ll face in the next installment

But I’m not afraid, I’m not deterred
‘Cause I believe in the power of the brave
To make a difference, to change the world
And to leave a legacy that will never fade.
