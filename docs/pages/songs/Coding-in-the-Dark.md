That's why I've put together this list of ironic pop songs that perfectly capture the essence of coding in the dark. So, flip on your headphones and get ready to groove to these tracks as you code through the night.

## 1. "All Night Long" by Lionel Richie

Nothing sets the mood for an all-night coding session like the upbeat rhythms of Lionel Richie. But while you may be coding "all night long," don't forget to take care of yourself too. Remember to take breaks, stretch your legs, and don't become a coding machine that only stops when the sun comes up.

## 2. "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor

When you're coding in the dark, you need the determination and strength of a fighter. "Eye of the Tiger" is an iconic tune that will keep you pumped up through those difficult coding problems.

Keep pushing, and you'll break free of that coding problem.

Sometimes, you just need a little bit of drama in your life. The epic "Bohemian Rhapsody" is the perfect accompaniment for those late nights of coding, with its soaring vocals and intricate instrumentals.
