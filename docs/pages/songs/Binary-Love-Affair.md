# Binary Love Affair

(Verse 1)  
I met a girl in cyberspace  
At first, I thought she was a glitch  
But as we started chatting away  
I knew my coding skills were rich  

(Chorus)  
It's a binary love affair  
01100110 01110101 01101110  
We're not your average love pair  
But our connection is like none  

(Verse 2)  
We started talking programming  
And nothing else seemed to matter  
Debugging code has never been so fun  
When we work together  

(Chorus)  
It's a binary love affair  
01101100 01101111 01110110 01100101  
We're not your average love pair  
But our connection is so complete  

(Bridge)  
We may not have met in person  
But our love is real as can be  
Our virtual world is our own  
And our love is our reality  

(Chorus)  
It's a binary love affair  
01101110 01101111 00100000 01100111 01101111 01101111 01100100 01100010 0111101  
We're not your average love pair  
But our connection is strong and rare  

(Verse 3)  
Our love may be unconventional  
But it's something special, that's for sure  
We may be from different worlds  
But our love transcends any code  

(Chorus)  
It's a binary love affair  
01110111 01101111 01101110 01100100 01100101 01110010 00100000 01110111 01101111 01101101 01100001 01101110  
We're not your average love pair  
But our connection is pure and raw  

(Outro)  
We'll keep loving each other  
In a world that might not understand  
Our binary love affair  
Will always be our perfect plan.
