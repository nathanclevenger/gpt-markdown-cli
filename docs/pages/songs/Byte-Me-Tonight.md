# Byte Me Tonight: An Ode to Tech Romance

Verse 1:
I was typing away on my keyboard, just minding my own biz
When you popped up on my screen, I couldn't believe what I had missed
Your code was so elegant, it made my heart skip a beat
I knew that I had to have you, my love for you was complete

Chorus:
Byte me tonight, oh won't you please
Show me your software expertise
We'll code together through the night
Tech love is what ignites

Verse 2:
We spent hours talking bugs and syntax, our love for tech so strong
You were my perfect match, I knew I didn't belong
With someone who didn't get my tech jokes and cipher speak
But with you by my side, I knew I had peaked

Chorus:
Byte me tonight, oh won't you please
Show me your software expertise
We'll code together through the night
Tech love is what ignites

Bridge:
Some might say our love is strange
But we're just two coders in our range
We speak the same language, it's clear to see
Our love for tech is what sets us free

Chorus:
Byte me tonight, oh won't you please
Show me your software expertise
We'll code together through the night
Tech love is what ignites

Outro:
So here we are, our love story's been told
We found each other through coding, and our love grew, oh so bold
Come, let's code together, and watch our love grow bright
Byte me tonight, my tech love, let's ignite.
