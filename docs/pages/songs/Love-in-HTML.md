# Love in HTML

Verse 1:
I used to be a lonesome coder,
Up all night with a cup of code,
But then you came along and I got bolder,
And my love for you just overflowed.

Chorus:
Our love is like HTML,
Structured, organized and neat,
Just like the code that we write,
Our love will stand the test of time.

Verse 2:
I once thought love was just for poets,
But then you made me see,
That love can be computerized,
And that's the perfect fit for me.

Chorus:
Our love is like HTML,
Structured, organized and neat,
Just like the code that we write,
Our love will stand the test of time.

Bridge:
You complete my function,
You validate my code,
Our love is wrapped in brackets,
And it's the perfect ode.

Chorus:
Our love is like HTML,
Structured, organized and neat,
Just like the code that we write,
Our love will stand the test of time.

Verse 3:
We may not always agree on syntax,
But we work through our differences,
Because our love is strong and resilient,
And it's based on mutual instances.

Chorus:
Our love is like HTML,
Structured, organized and neat,
Just like the code that we write,
Our love will stand the test of time.

Outro:
So here's to you my dearest love,
My partner in bytes and bits,
Together we'll write the perfect code,
And our love will never quit.
