*Verse 1:*

We started with a spark, an idea in our minds  
We gathered all our courage and left the rest behind  
Tried to pitch to investors, some didn't want to believe  
But we knew in our hearts, this startup we must achieve  

*Chorus:*

The startup fire, it's burning bright  
The passion and perseverance, keep us in sight  
Through long days and tough nights  
We keep marching forward, fueling the startup fire  

*Verse 2:*

The product started forming, we had a prototype  
We hit the market running, with no end in sight  
The competition fierce, we faced rejection and doubt  
But our fire kept burning, we refused to back out  

*Chorus:*

The startup fire, it's burning bright  
The passion and perseverance, keep us in sight  
Through long days and tough nights  
We keep marching forward, fueling the startup fire  

*Bridge:*

There were days when we thought we couldn't go on  
When it seemed like all hope was gone  
But the fire kept burning, stronger every day  
And we knew that we'd find a way  

*Chorus:*

The startup fire, it's burning bright  
The passion and perseverance, keep us in sight  
Through long days and tough nights  
We keep marching forward, fueling the startup fire  

*Verse 3:*

Our user base was growing, we saw validation  
Investors came knocking, with offers of collaboration  
We hit some milestones, and celebrated our wins  
But we still knew that the startup fire, never ends  

*Chorus:*

The startup fire, it's burning bright  
The passion and perseverance, keep us in sight  
Through long days and tough nights  
We keep marching forward, fueling the startup fire  

*Outro:*

The startup fire, it's burning bright  
The passion and perseverance, never out of sight  
We'll keep stoking the flames, as we reach higher and higher  
And together we'll keep fueling the startup fire
