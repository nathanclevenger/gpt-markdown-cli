# I Can't Quit You, Parentheses: An Ode to Coding

As coders, we all know the love-hate relationship we have with parentheses. They can be our best friend or our worst enemy. They can make our code concise and clear or cluttered and confusing. But no matter how frustrating they can be, we can't quit them. That's why I present to you the ironic pop song, "I Can't Quit You, Parentheses."

Verse 1:
I start a new line of code, feeling free
But then those pesky brackets stare back at me
I try to resist, I really do
But every time I code, they come shining through

Chorus:
Oh, I can't quit you, parentheses
You bring order to my code, oh so great
But sometimes I wish I could throw you away
Still, I can't quit you, parentheses

Verse 2:
I try to make my code look neat
But then those brackets show up in the street
I try to reason, I try to plead
But they won't leave, no matter what I need

Chorus:
Oh, I can't quit you, parentheses
You bring order to my code, oh so great
But sometimes I wish I could throw you away
Still, I can't quit you, parentheses

Bridge:
I know you keep my code so tight
But sometimes I wish you weren't in sight
Oh, why must I love you so
When you bring me such sorrow?

Chorus:
Oh, I can't quit you, parentheses
You bring order to my code, oh so great
But sometimes I wish I could throw you away
Still, I can't quit you, parentheses

Outro:
Oh, parentheses, you drive me mad
But without you, my code would be bad
I guess I love you, more than I know
I can't quit you, parentheses, even though

There you have it, folks. A song dedicated to the love-hate relationship we have with parentheses in coding. While they can be frustrating at times, we can't deny their importance in keeping our code organized and efficient. Sometimes, we just have to accept that we can't quit them.
