# Breakin' Through the Glass Ceiling

It’s been a long journey, but I’m finally here  
I’m on top of the world, I’ve conquered my fear  
I’ve been working hard, every day and night  
Now it’s time to celebrate, it’s time to see the light  

Chorus:  
Breakin’ through the glass ceiling  
Rising up to the top  
Our startup’s never stopping  
We’ll never, ever drop  

We started from scratch, with nothing in hand  
But we had a dream, and we had a plan  
We built it from the ground up, with sweat and tears  
Now we’re the leaders, and our vision is clear  

Chorus  

We faced obstacles, like rocky terrain  
But we kept pushing through, we didn’t complain  
We learned from our failures, we grew from our mistakes  
And now our hard work, it pays off, it breaks  

Chorus  

We’re no longer the underdogs, we’re the ones to watch  
We’re a force to be reckoned with, we’re a ticking clock  
We’re game changers, we’re innovators  
We’re the ones who made it, we’re the creators  

Chorus  

We’ve overcome the odds, we’ve proved them all wrong  
We’ve silenced the skeptics, with our startup song  
We’ve made it to the top, with our hard work and grit  
And now we’re here to stay, we’ll never quit  

Chorus  

We’re ready to take on the world, and make our mark  
We’re ready to show them what we can do, in the dark  
We’re ready to challenge the status quo, and break the mold  
We’re ready to be fearless, and let our startup story unfold  

Chorus  

So let’s raise a glass, to our startup crew  
To all the hard work, that we’ve pushed through  
To all the obstacles, that we’ve overcome  
To all the battles, that we’ve won  

Chorus  

We’re the ones who broke through, the glass ceiling  
We’re the ones who made it, without a feeling  
Of doubt or fear, we’ve conquered it all  
We’re the ones who stand tall  

Chorus  

So keep pushing forward, keep chasing your dream  
Never give up, no matter how hard it may seem  
Keep breaking barriers, keep reaching for the sky  
Even if you don’t know how, just give it a try  

Chorus  

Because when you do, when you finally break through  
When you finally see the light, and your dreams come true  
It’ll all be worth it, every single step  
The journey, the struggles, the tears that we’ve wept  

Chorus  

And then you’ll know, that you’re unstoppable  
That you can conquer anything, that’s untoppable  
That you’re a game changer, an innovator  
That you’re a creator  

Chorus  

So go out there, and break through the glass ceiling  
Rise up to the top, and keep achieving  
Your startup dreams, your goals, your passion  
And never forget that you’re magic  

Chorus  

Because you are, you’re unstoppable  
You can conquer anything, that’s untoppable  
You’re a game changer, an innovator  
You’re a creator  

Chorus  

Breakin’ through the glass ceiling  
Rising up to the top  
Our startup’s never stopping  
We’ll never, ever drop
